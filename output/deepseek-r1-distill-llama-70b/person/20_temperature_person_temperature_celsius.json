I remember from school that normal body temperature is usually around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

Maybe I should look up the exact average. Wait, I think it's somewhere between 36 and 37 degrees Celsius. Let me think, 98.6°F converts to Celsius by subtracting 32 and then multiplying by 5/9.

I think it's important to note that while 37°C is the typical number given, the actual average might be a little lower, around 36.8°C. \n\nI should also consider that different measurement methods can affect the temperature.

This is a well-established fact in medical literature. So, I'm pretty confident that the value should be in that range.\n\nNext, the user specified that the response should be in JSON format.
