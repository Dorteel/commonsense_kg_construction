The question specifies to return a single float, not a range. The key here is to provide the temperature as a float in the JSON.\n\nI need to check if there's a consensus. The traditional value is 98.6°F, which comes from Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich's research in the 19th century. However, more recent studies indicate that the average might be lower. For example, a study from the University of Maryland found an average of 98.2°F. But since the user is asking for the average temperature of a human being, maybe they expect the standard value that's commonly taught, even if it's not the latest research. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go with the more recent average. But the problem is, different sources might give different numbers. If the user wants a precise answer, perhaps the best approach is to use the standard 98.6°F. However, if there's a more accurate current average, that should be considered. Let me verify. \n\nLooking it up, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that the normal adult body temperature ranges from 97°F to 99°F. The average is around 98.6°F, but this can vary. However, some recent studies suggest the average is about 98.2°F. For example, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that the average is 98.6°F for men and 98.4°F for women. But there's variation based on factors like age and time of day. \n\nGiven that the user wants the average temperature as a float in Fahrenheit, and considering that the most commonly cited average is 98.6°F, even though it might not be the most up-to-date, I should probably use that. Alternatively, if the latest data is considered, maybe 98.2°F. Hmm. The user might not be aware of the recent studies, so perhaps the standard answer is expected here. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the average temperature for humans is considered to be around 98.6°F, so that's the value to use. To confirm, I can check a reliable source. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) states that the average is 98.6°F, but also mentions that this can vary. So, given that the user is asking for the average, and the most commonly accepted value is 98.6, that's the safest bet. \n\nTherefore, the JSON should be {\"temperature\": 98.6}.\n</think>\n\n{\"temperature\": 98.6}"
