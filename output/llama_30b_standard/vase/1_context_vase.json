Vases are often used for decorative purposes, but may also hold potted plants. Many vases are also made for utensils, as well. Presently, there is a large variety of sizes and styles of vases available for purchase. Vases are most often made of glass or ceramics but can be of other materials such as brass, silver, gold, wood, stone, acrylic, plastic, or non-rusting metals. Vases are often decorated with a variety of patterns and colors, and some are made in the form of animals or other objects. Specialized vases are often given as a gift, during birthdays, anniversaries and the like. Vases are also used in religious practices, for example, Buddhist monks use them to hold flowers that are offered as alms to the spirit. Vases come in different shapes and sizes. Most vases are approximately 10–20 inches tall. There are also miniature vases, usually with a height of 4–6 inches. The height of vases can also be as low as 3 inches or as high as 30 inches. A vase in which flowers are displayed is called a floral vase. A floral vase is usually used to display one type of flower, though it is possible to put more than one type of flower in a floral vase. A floral vase can also be used to hold a single flower, or a small bunch of flowers. Floral vases are usually made of glass, ceramics, or plastic. They can be made of other materials, too, such as wood, stone, or metal. Floral vases are usually decorated with various types of patterns"
