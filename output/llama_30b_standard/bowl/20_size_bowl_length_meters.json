It is a container with a flat bottom and usually a raised edge. It is usually smaller than a platter, deeper than a plate, and wider than a cup. The bowl is also used for liquid dishes, such as soup, stew, or pudding. The bowl is known to be used as early as the Neolithic era. A bowl can be made from ceramic, metal, glass, plastic, wood and other materials. Many bowls are also made from combinations of materials, such as glass and metal, or ceramic and metal. In the first millennium BC, bowls began to be produced in large quantities by firing clay in a kiln. Bowls made by this process have been discovered at the site of Sutton Hoo, a 7th-century BC royal ship burial in East Anglia, England. Bowls were popular in ancient times.
