Bears are generally solitary creatures, although they do have social structures, and they generally follow a carnivorous diet. Bears are generally considered to be the most dangerous mammals in the world. Bear attacks on humans are extremely rare, but they do happen and can be quite brutal. The most dangerous bear to humans is the brown bear, or grizzly bear. The grizzly bear can weigh up to 1,500 pounds and are incredibly strong. Grizzly bears are extremely protective of their young and will attack any creature that they perceive to be a threat. Grizzly bears are also extremely territorial. If a grizzly bear senses that you are a threat, it will attack. This is why hikers are advised not to run from a bear. Running may be interpreted as a sign of aggression. If you encounter a grizzly bear, make yourself as large as possible and avoid making any sudden movements. If you can, slowly back away and leave the area. If the bear does attack, fight back with everything you have. Punch the bear in the nose if you can. A grizzly bear will often stop attacking if it gets a nose full of blood. If you have no choice but to play dead, protect your vital organs as much as possible and cover your face. When the bear bites down, he will most likely break your bones. Don't try to get up until you are sure the bear has left the area. Once you are sure the bear has left, try to get to safety as quickly as possible. Grizzly bear attacks are rare"

Adult males weigh on average between 130 and 200 kilograms (290 and 440 pounds) and measure from 1.6 to 2 metres (5 ft 3 in to 6 ft 6 in) long; the females are smaller, averaging 90–140 kilograms (200–310 pounds) and measuring 1.4 to 1.8 metres (4 ft 7 in to 5 ft 11 in) long. The American black bear was once classified as a subspecies of the brown bear but is now considered a separate species. Although these bears look quite different from one another, they can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. American black bears are omnivores, with their diets varying greatly depending on season and location. They typically live in largely forested areas, but do leave forests in search of food. Sometimes they become attracted to human communities because of the immediate availability of food. The American black bear is the world's most common bear species. It is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a least-concern species. For more information on this bear, read here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_black_bear."
