Cakes normally combine some kind of fat, flour, eggs, sugar, and a leavening agent, with some common additional ingredients such as dried fruit, nuts, or extracts. Some cakes are filled with fruit preserves or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders or candied fruit. Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old. Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labour went into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur of cooks may bake a cake. Cake making is often a hobby for some, and a profession for many others. Cakes can also be very decorative, and artists create edible art. Cakes are often given to celebrate a person's birthday. Cake is often served at celebrations, such as weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. "
