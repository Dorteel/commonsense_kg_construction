Its species name derives from its coat patterns that consists of brown patches separated by light-colored, saffron-colored lines. Each individual giraffe has a unique coat pattern, and researchers use them to identify or distinguish between individuals. The number of spots on their coat is also unique for each giraffe. The species is native to Africa, but has been introduced to North America and is found in large game reserves. The giraffe's scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach. They may be preyed on by lions, leopards, spotted hyenas and African wild dogs. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations. Males establish social hierarchies through \"\n}\n"
