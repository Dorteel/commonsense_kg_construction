The most common type of bicycle is the upright bicycle, which is recognized by most people and the most popular type used. The first mechanically propelled, two-wheeled vehicle may have been built by Kirkpatrick MacMillan of Scotland around 1839. Most bicycles in use today are inexpensive and simple, and are used for recreation and transportation. The bicycle has been around for more than 200 years, and has gone through many changes since it was invented. Bicycles are very popular all around the world. They are very popular in countries like China and the Netherlands, but are also very popular in many countries like the United States, Canada, and Australia. The bicycle is the most popular vehicle on the planet, with over 1 billion in existence in 2003, and 66 million sold in 2004. The bicycle is the most efficient human-powered means of transportation in terms of energy a person must expend to travel a given distance. Bicycles are also very popular for sporting activities, such as bicycle racing, mountain biking, recreational cycling, and touring. Bicycles can be used for exercise, transportation, and as a sport, and are sometimes used by police forces, couriers, and the military. Bicycles are also used for personal enjoyment.
