Sandwiches are a popular type of lunch food, taken to work, school, or picnics to be eaten as part of a packed lunch. The sandwich began as a portable finger food in the Western world, and over time, has become prevalent worldwide. Some of the earliest sandwiches were produced at the start of the 19th century in the United Kingdom. Today the sandwich is found in numerous incarnations, with varying sizes, fillings and components. The sandwich was originally known as a bread and butter. The first recorded use of the word sandwich is in the 1762 satirical English diary, The Sandwich-nation. The sandwich is named after John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, the inventor of this food combination, who ordered his valet to bring him meat tucked between two pieces of bread, and he liked it so much that he then had it brought to him for all his meals, as a consequence of which, he did not get up from the gaming table to eat his food. The sandwich was first known as a 'bread and meat' in England, and the first written usage is in Edward Gibbons journal in 1762. The name 'sandwich' is a 20th-century invention, though the term 'sandwiches' is found in the 19th century. The term 'sandwich', though it is not known when this was first used, may have come from"

The sandwich was originally a portable food item or finger food which began its popularity in the Western World, but is now found in various versions in numerous cultures. For example, in Italian, the word sandwich is translated as tramezzino (plural tramezzini). The sandwich is the namesake of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, as the story goes, the inventor of this food combination. The modern concept of a sandwich using slices of bread as found in the West can arguably be traced to 18th-century Europe. However, the use of internal bread fillings dates from the 1st century B.C. to Rome. The basic concept of bread with filling has been used for millennia; the ancient Jewish sage Hillel the Elder is said to have placed meat from the Paschal lamb and bitter herbs between two pieces of matzo (flat, unleavened bread) during Passover, giving a name and a date to the culinary concept of a sandwich. Nevertheless, the sandwich made with sliced bread appears to be a relatively modern invention. The first known use of the English word appeared in the 18th century, and is alleged to be named after one of the Earls of Sandwich, either John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich or his son, also called John, who succeeded to the title as 5th Earl of Sandwich in 1792."
