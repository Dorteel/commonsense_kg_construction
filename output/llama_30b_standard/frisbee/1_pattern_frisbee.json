Players use golf discs, akin to the balls used in golf. The object of the game is to complete each hole in the fewest number of throws. The rules are more similar to golf than the rules of Ultimate, but there is no running with the disc, and a golf disc is smaller (about 25% of the diameter of a golf ball), heavier, and slower than a golf ball. The game is played like golf, except when a disc is thrown and hits the pole, the thrower receives a stroke. The pole is 50 feet tall, and when hit, is an automatic birdie. The pole is moved further back for more experienced players. The hole is a basket with chains that is 30 feet tall, with the basket being 6 feet off the ground. The object is to get the disc in the basket in the fewest number of throws. The thrower is allowed to move up to the lie where the disc came to rest after the throw. The player then throws again from the lie. Once a disc is in the basket, the hole is completed. The total strokes plus the result (birdie, par, bogey, etc.) is the player's score for the hole. Most courses have 9 or 18 holes."
