Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. Birds have wings which are more or less developed depending on the species; the only known groups to have become extinct in recent times are the dodo and the great auk. The fossil record indicates that birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs during the Jurassic period, around 160–200 Ma (million years ago), and the earliest known bird is the Late Jurassic Archaeopteryx, c 155–150 Ma. Most researchers consider the nearby Confuciusornis and others to be older members of the avian lineage rather than ancestors to today's birds; an earlier candidate was the Late Triassic prototype bird Archaeornis. The closest living relatives of birds are the crocodilians. Birds' feathers evolved from the scales of dinosaurs, which were then modified into flight feathers, waterproof feathers, under down feathers, and colorful plumage feathers. The earliest birds were arboreal, and either glided from"
