Knives are made with either a fixed or folding blade and with or without handles. Knives can also be used as utensils, as in eating and food preparation. \\n\\nKnives are used as utensils, as cutting tools, as a weapon and in numerous other uses. As a weapon, a knife may be used to enable physical assault, or as a defensive tool, used in self-defense, or in combat; either militarily, or by law-enforcement officers, and civilians. Knives deliberately designed for violence or combat are referred to as daggers. Some of the earliest human archaeological artifacts are knives, the oldest of which (found in the Tianze cave, in the Nihewan Basin) have been dated to around 75,000 years ago. Knives appear to have been invented around the same time as spears \\u2013 between 250,000 and 100,000 years ago \\u2013 by the Oldowan culture, though their use only became common much later. Knives have been used since prehistoric times for utility purposes such as preparing food, as well as a weapon. \\n\\nA knife with a cutting edge is called a blade as in blade of grass. But when the edge is not applicable as a cutting implement, such as a serrated edge, it is called a cutting surface. An edge is only sharp sufficient to cut if it can be lined up with the applied force in the right direction, and if the edge is strong enough to avoid breaking. This is usually the case"
