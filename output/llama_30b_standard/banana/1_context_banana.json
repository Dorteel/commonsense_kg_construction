The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe. The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible bananas come from two wild species – Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. The scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa × paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata × Musa balbisiana, depending on their genomic constitution and origin. The old scientific name Musa sapientum is no longer used. Musa species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia, and are likely to have been first domesticated in Papua New Guinea. They are grown in at least 107 countries, primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent to make fiber, banana wine, and as ornamental plants. Worldwide, there is no sharp distinction between \"\n    , \"bananas and plantains. However, the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) assigns specific codes to its collections of cultivars according to their uses, and the FAO reports the distinction of bananas and plantains as \"\n    : \"plantains are"
