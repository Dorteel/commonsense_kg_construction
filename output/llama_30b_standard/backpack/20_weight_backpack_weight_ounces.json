Traditional backpacks only have one main compartment. Backpacks are sometimes used as fashion accessories, in which they serve as purses. Backpacks are common among travellers and hikers. Backpacks are sometimes worn as backpacks, with the shoulder-straps arranged so that they cross in the back, as well as being worn with one strap higher than the other. The backpack is more popular in modern times than the traditional satchel.
