The carrot is a domesticated form of the wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and southwestern Asia. It has been bred and cultivated for its edible, mostly taproots and its greens. The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged and more palatable, less woody-textured edible taproot. The edible part of the plant is the taproot, which is a kind of root vegetable. The carrot plant is a biennial plant that grows a rosette of leaves in the spring and summer, while building up the stout taproot, which stores sugars for the plant to flower in the second year. The flowering stem grows to about 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) tall, with an umbel of white flowers that produce a fruit called a mericarp by botanists, which is a type of schizocarp. The fruit is a small carrot shaped and coloured, but with its tips lobed and notched like other members of Apiaceae, or the umbelliferae. The domesticated carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured taproot. The domestic carrot is known by its common name carrot, but it is also known by other names, including botanical names and regional names. The wild ancestor of the carrot is the horned parsnip, which has a root that has a combination of traits from the modern carrot and its close relative, the parsnip. The modern carrot has been selectively bred for its enlarged, more palatable, less woody"
