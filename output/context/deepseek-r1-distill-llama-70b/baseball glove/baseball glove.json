Let me start by understanding each property and see how it applies.\n\nFirst, color. Baseball gloves can come in different colors, but I'm not sure if it's a defining feature. They're often brown or black, but maybe color isn't the most important aspect.\n\nShape is definitely relevant because the structure of the glove is crucial for catching and throwing. It has fingers and a palm area, so shape matters a lot.\n\nLocation is always important because it tells us where the glove is used, like on a baseball field.\n\nTexture might be relevant since the material's feel can affect grip and comfort.\n\nMaterial is important because the type of leather or synthetic material affects performance and durability.\n\nScenario is about the situation where the glove is used, like in a game or practice, which helps understand its context.\n\nPattern could relate to the design or stitching, which might be important for functionality or brand identity.\n\nContext is a bit vague, but in general, it's always relevant to understand how the glove is used.\n\nDisposition isn't really applicable here since it refers to a person's attitude, not an object.\n\nFunction is crucial because the glove's purpose is to aid in catching and throwing.\n\nSize is important because gloves come in different sizes to fit various hands.\n\nWeight could matter for comfort and ease of use during the game.\n\nTemperature isn't directly relevant unless we're talking about how the glove feels in different weather, but that's probably not a primary concern.\n\nValue is about cost or worth, which isn't a defining characteristic of the glove itself.\n\nSo, I'll go through each property and mark them as true or false based on this reasoning.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"concept\": \"baseball glove\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"While baseball gloves may have varying colours, colour is not a defining or distinguishing feature of their function or purpose.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The shape of a baseball glove is crucial for its function, as it is designed to fit the hand and allow for catching and throwing.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is always relevant as it helps contextualize where the baseball glove is used, such as on a baseball field.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The texture of the glove, particularly the material's feel, can affect grip and comfort during use.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Material is important because it affects the durability, comfort, and performance of the glove.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario is relevant as it describes the situations in which the glove is used, such as in a game or practice.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Pattern can refer to the design or stitching, which may affect functionality or brand identity.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Context is always relevant as it provides background information on how the glove is used within the game of baseball.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition refers to a person's attitude, which is not applicable to an inanimate object like a baseball glove.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Function is crucial as it defines the purpose of the glove, which is to aid in catching and throwing the ball.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Size is important because gloves come in different sizes to fit various hand sizes.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight can affect the comfort and ease of use of the glove during play.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature is not a primary concern unless discussing how the glove feels in different weather, which is secondary.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Value refers to cost or worth, which is not a defining characteristic of the glove itself.\"\n  }\n}\n```"
