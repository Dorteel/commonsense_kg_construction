The concept is a surfboard, which is described as a narrow buoyant board used for riding surf. The candidate properties given are color, shape, location, texture, material, scenario, pattern, context, disposition, function, size, weight, temperature, and value.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a relevant descriptor is. It's a property that helps characterize, distinguish, or understand the concept in everyday or expert knowledge. So, I should go through each property one by one and decide if it's relevant to a surfboard.\n\nStarting with color: Surfboards do come in various colors and patterns. The color can be important for aesthetics and maybe even for visibility in the water. So, color is probably a relevant descriptor.\n\nNext is shape: The shape of a surfboard is crucial. Different shapes affect how the board performs in the waterâ€”like how it cuts through waves or turns. So, shape is definitely relevant.\n\nLocation: This might be a bit tricky. While the location where you use the surfboard (like the beach or specific surf spots) is important contextually, is the property 'location' itself a descriptor of the surfboard? I'm not sure. It might be more about where it's used rather than a property of the board itself. So, maybe location isn't a relevant descriptor for the surfboard.\n\nTexture: The texture of the surfboard's surface can affect grip and how the rider interacts with it. Most surfboards have a waxed texture for traction, so texture is relevant.\n\nMaterial: The material used to make the surfboard is important. It affects buoyancy, durability, and performance. So, material is definitely a relevant descriptor.\n\nScenario: This seems more about the context in which the surfboard is used rather than a property of the board itself. So, scenario might not be a relevant descriptor.\n\nPattern: Similar to color, patterns on a surfboard can be part of its design and help in identifying the board or brand. So, pattern is relevant.\n\nContext: This is a broad term and might be similar to scenario. It's more about the situation or environment where the surfboard is used, not a direct property of the board. So, context might not be a relevant descriptor.\n\nDisposition: This refers to the attitude or mood, which doesn't seem directly relevant to describing a surfboard. So, disposition is probably not relevant.\n\nFunction: The function of a surfboard is to ride waves, which is a core aspect of its purpose. So, function is a relevant descriptor.\n\nSize: The size of the surfboard is important as it affects how it performs in the water and suits different riders. So, size is relevant.\n\nWeight: The weight of the surfboard can impact its maneuverability and how easy it is to carry. So, weight is relevant.\n\nTemperature: The temperature of the surfboard itself isn't typically a key descriptor. While the water temperature might matter for the rider, the board's temperature isn't usually a relevant factor. So, temperature is probably not relevant.\n\nValue: The value, whether monetary or otherwise, is a relevant descriptor as it can indicate the board's quality, brand, or market position. So, value is relevant.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll go through each property and mark them as true or false based on whether they are relevant. I also need to provide a reason for each choice, either explaining why it's relevant or noting that it's universally relevant across all concepts.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"concept\": \"surfboard\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Surfboards are often designed with specific colours for aesthetics and visibility.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The shape affects the surfboard's performance and handling in the water.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is not a property of the surfboard itself but rather where it is used.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Texture affects grip and interaction with the rider, often featuring wax for traction.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Material impacts buoyancy, durability, and overall performance.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario pertains to usage context, not a property of the surfboard.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Patterns are part of the design, aiding in identification and brand recognition.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Context is about the environment, not a direct property of the surfboard.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition refers to attitude, not a characteristic of the surfboard.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Function is core to the surfboard's purpose of riding waves.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Size affects performance and suitability for different riders.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight influences maneuverability and portability.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature of the board itself is not a key descriptor.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Value indicates quality, brand, and market position.\"\n  }\n}\n```"
