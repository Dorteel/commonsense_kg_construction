  You are a commonsense knowledge engineer. Your task is to identify which properties are **relevant descriptors** for a given concept. A relevant descriptor is a property that helps meaningfully characterize, distinguish, or understand the concept in everyday or expert knowledge.

  Below is the concept and its description:

  **Concept**: {concept} with description: {description_clause}

  Here is a list of candidate properties:
  {properties_clause}

  Your output should be a **JSON object** containing:

  - `"concept"`: the name of the concept  
  - one entry per property, each with:
    - a `"value"` field (boolean: `true` or `false`)  
    - a `"reason"` field (short explanation of your choice)

  For the always-relevant properties, simply explain that they are **universally relevant across all concepts**.

  **Output format (example)**:  
    "concept": "apple",
    "colour":
      "value": true,
      "reason": "Apples are commonly identified and categorized by their color.",
    "location":
      "value": true,
      "reason": "Location is always relevant as it helps contextualize the presence or use of any object."
    ,
