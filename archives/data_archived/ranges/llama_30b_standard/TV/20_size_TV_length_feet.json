The tuner accepts the television signal from an external source, such as cable or satellite, and is used to tune to the proper\\nfrequency or television channel (when television signals were analog, it would use a knob or buttons to select the channel and tune the signal to the\\nchannel). The display, which is usually a cathode-ray tube (CRT) in older televisions (but is now mostly a display panel in newer sets) is used to display the image from the\\ntuner, so that it can be viewed by the viewer. The speakers are used to play the audio portion of the television signal, so that a person can hear the\\nbroadcast. A television set may be a standalone device used solely for television viewing, or may be incorporated with a video cassette recorder or DVD\\nplayer and video game console. Television sets may also play media from a USB flash drive or media player. Many sets in the 21st century have a\\nHDMI connector, making it possible to use the television as a computer monitor. In the 2010s, televisions may also be considered \" ,\" which allow viewing of content\\nthrough the Internet.\\n\\nThe advent of television has had a significant impact on the world, and has become a part of daily life in many parts of the world.
