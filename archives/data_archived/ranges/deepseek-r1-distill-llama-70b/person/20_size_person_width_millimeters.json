Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"size\" refers to here. Since it's about a person, I'm assuming they mean height. People vary in height, so I should consider the average range.\n\nI know that the average height for adults is around 1.7 meters, but that's just an average. To get the range, I should think about the typical minimum and maximum heights.\n\nFor min_size, I'll consider the height of a newborn baby. Newborns are typically around 500 mm, but they grow quickly. Maybe the minimum height for a person, considering all ages, is about 400 mm, but that might be too low. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to adults, so maybe I should adjust that.\n\nWait, no, the user didn't specify age, so I should include the entire human lifespan. Newborns are about 500 mm, so maybe the min_size is 500 mm.\n\nFor max_size, the tallest people are around 2.4 meters, like Robert Wadlow. So converting that to millimeters, that's 2400 mm.\n\nWait, but 2.4 meters is extremely rare. Maybe the typical max is lower, like 2.2 meters, but to cover the range, I should include the maximum known height.\n\nSo, putting it together, min_size would be 500 mm and max_size 2400 mm.\n\nI should make sure the units are correct. 1 meter is 1000 mm, so 0.5 meters is 500 mm, and 2.4 meters is 2400 mm.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the JSON should have min_size as 500.0 and max_size as 2400.0.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Query:** The user is asking for the typical height range of a person measured in millimeters, to be returned in JSON format with keys `min_size` and `max_size`.\n\n2. **Defining \"Person\":** A person refers to a human being, and the size in question is height.\n\n3. **Determining Measurement Units:** Convert height from meters to millimeters (1 meter = 1000 millimeters).\n\n4. **Establishing Typical Range:**\n   - **Minimum Height:** Considering newborns, the average height is around 500 mm (0.5 meters).\n   - **Maximum Height:** The tallest recorded person was Robert Wadlow at 2.4 meters, which is 2400 mm.\n\n5. **Constructing the JSON Response:** Using the calculated values, format the response with the specified keys.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"min_size\": 500.0,\n  \"max_size\": 2400.0\n}\n```"

The user has specified that the concept is a human being, so I'm focusing on adults here. \n\nFirst, I should consider the average height of an adult. I know that the average height for adults varies, but it's generally around 1.6 to 1.8 meters. To convert meters to millimeters, I multiply by 1000. So, 1.6 meters is 1600 mm, and 1.8 meters is 1800 mm. \n\nWait, but is that the min and max? Maybe I should consider a broader range to include shorter and taller individuals. Let me think: the shortest adults might be around 1.5 meters, which is 1500 mm, and the tallest could be up to 2.0 meters, which is 2000 mm. That seems reasonable. \n\nI should double-check if 1.5 to 2.0 meters is a typical range. Yeah, I've heard that some people are as short as 1.5 meters and others can be over 2 meters tall, though that's less common. \n\nSo, putting it together, the min_size would be 1500 mm and the max_size would be 2000 mm.

    "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the typical range size of a person in millimeters. Let's start by understanding what exactly is meant by \"size\" here. I think it refers to the average height of a human being because that's the most common measurement when talking about a person's size.\n\nI remember that the average height varies slightly between different regions and ethnicities, but generally, for adult humans, the average height is around 1.7 to 1.8 meters. Wait, but the user wants the measurement in millimeters. So I should convert meters to millimeters. \n\nSince 1 meter is 1000 millimeters, 1.7 meters would be 1700 millimeters, and 1.8 meters would be 1800 millimeters. That gives a range from 1700mm to 1800mm. \n\nI should make sure that this is the typical range and not the absolute minimum or maximum. I think the average is a good representation here. So, the min_size would be 1700.0 and the max_size would be 1800.0.\n\nI need to present this in JSON format with the keys \"min_size\" and \"max_size\" as floats. So, the JSON should look like:\n{\n  \"min_size\": 1700.0,\n  \"max_size\": 1800.0\n}\n\nI think that's all. I should double-check if the conversion from meters to millimeters is correct. Yes, multiplying by 1000 is the right approach. Also, considering that the question is about the typical range, using the average height range makes sense. I don't think I need to consider other measurements like weight or body dimensions because the question specifically mentions size, which is typically associated with height.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"min_size\": 1700.0,\n  \"max_size\": 1800.0\n}\n```"

They mentioned that I should return only JSON with min_size and max_size as keys. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"size\" refers to here. It could mean height, since that's a common measurement for people. Yeah, I think that's what they're asking about.\n\nNow, considering the average height of an adult. I remember that globally, the average height for an adult male is around 172 cm, and for females, it's about 158 cm. But wait, the user wants the range, so I should consider the typical minimum and maximum heights.\n\nFor adults, the typical range is probably from about 150 cm to 190 cm. That makes sense because most adults fall into that range, though there are exceptions. But for this case, we'll stick to the typical range.\n\nNow, the user asked for millimeters, so I need to convert centimeters to millimeters. Since 1 cm is 10 mm, I'll multiply each value by 10.\n\nSo, 150 cm becomes 1500 mm, and 190 cm becomes 1900 mm. That gives the min_size as 1500.0 and max_size as 1900.0.\n\nI should make sure to structure the JSON correctly with these keys. Also, the user emphasized to return only valid JSON, so I need to ensure there are no errors in the format.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have min_size as 1500.0 and max_size as 1900.0. That should cover the typical range for the height of a person in millimeters.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"min_size\": 1500.0,\n  \"max_size\": 1900.0\n}\n```"

I remember that the average height for an adult human is around 1.7 meters, but I should verify this. Maybe it's slightly different for males and females, but for a general estimate, 1.7 meters is a good starting point.\n\nWait, the user is asking for millimeters, so I need to convert meters to millimeters. Since 1 meter is 1000 millimeters, 1.7 meters would be 1700 millimeters. But that's just the average. I need a range, so I should think about the minimum and maximum heights.\n\nI know that the smallest adults in the world are around 60-65 cm tall, which would be 600 to 650 millimeters. On the taller end, the tallest people can be around 2.3 to 2.4 meters, so that's 2300 to 2400 millimeters. \n\nBut wait, those extremes are pretty rare. Maybe for a more typical range, excluding the extreme cases, the average person might be between 150 cm and 190 cm. Converting that to millimeters, that's 1500 mm to 1900 mm.\n\nI should double-check these numbers. Let me think: 1 meter is 1000 mm, so 1.5 meters is 1500 mm, and 1.9 meters is 1900 mm. That seems reasonable. So, the min_size would be 1500.0 and max_size 1900.0.\n\nI need to make sure I'm using the correct units and that the JSON structure is accurate. The keys should be min_size and max_size, both as floats. So, the JSON would look like {\"min_size\":1500.0, \"max_size\":1900.0}.\n\nI think that's a solid approach.

The user wants a JSON response with min_size and max_size as keys. \n\nFirst, I should consider what \"size\" refers to. It could be height, but since the unit is millimeters, maybe it's about something else. Wait, no, height makes sense. People are often measured by their height. So I'll go with that.\n\nNow, what's the average height range for humans? I remember that adults typically range from about 1.5 meters to 1.9 meters. But wait, that's in meters, and the user wants millimeters. So I need to convert those.\n\n1.5 meters is 1500 millimeters, and 1.9 meters is 1900 millimeters. That seems right. But wait, maybe I should check if that's accurate. I think the average height for an adult is around 1.7 to 1.8 meters, so 1700 to 1800 mm. But the range might be broader when considering all humans.\n\nI should also think about the minimum and maximum possible heights. The smallest person in recorded history was He Pingping, who was about 74.6 cm, which is 746 mm. The tallest was Robert Wadlow, who was 272.6 cm, which is 2726 mm. But wait, that's in centimeters. So converting that, 746 mm and 2726 mm.\n\nWait, that seems too broad. Maybe the user is asking for typical adults, not including extreme cases. So perhaps the min_size is around 1500 mm (1.5 meters) and max_size around 1900 mm (1.9 meters). That makes sense because it covers the average range for adults.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused. Should I include children? If I do, the min_size would be lower. But the concept is about a person, which is a human being in general. So maybe I should include the full range from infants to adults. However, infants are much smaller, like around 500 mm at birth, but that's probably not necessary here. The user might be referring to adults.\n\nWait, the initial response I gave was min_size: 1500.0 and max_size: 1900.0. That seems reasonable for adults. But I'm not entirely sure if the user wants to include all humans or just adults. Since the concept is a person, which can be any age, maybe I should consider a broader range.\n\nBut if I include infants, the min_size would be around 500 mm, which is 50 cm, a typical newborn length. The max would still be around 2726 mm for the tallest person. But that's a huge range and might not be what the user expects. They might be looking for adult sizes.\n\nI think it's safer to stick with adult heights since that's the most common context when referring to a person's size. So 1500 mm to 1900 mm is appropriate. That's 1.5 meters to 1.9 meters, which covers the average range for adults globally.\n\nSo, I'll structure the JSON with min_size as 1500.0 and max_size as 1900.0. That should meet the user's requirements.\n</think>\n\n**JSON Response:**\n```json\n{\n  \"min_size\": 1500.0,\n  \"max_size\": 1900.0\n}\n```"

Hmm, I remember that the average height for adults varies between men and women, but I'm not sure about the exact numbers. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I know that average heights are usually measured in centimeters or inches. For adults, I think the average is somewhere around 160-180 cm for females and 170-190 cm for males, but I'm not 100% certain. Wait, maybe it's a bit more precise. I think for women, it's about 158 cm to 172 cm, and for men, it's around 172 cm to 188 cm or so.\n\nBut the question is about the overall typical range, so I should consider the smallest and largest typical heights. I remember hearing that the shortest adults are around 130-140 cm, and the tallest can be over 200 cm, but those are exceptions. So maybe the typical range is from about 150 cm to 200 cm.\n\nWait, but the user wants the size in millimeters, so I need to convert that. 1 meter is 1000 millimeters, so 1 cm is 10 mm. So 150 cm would be 1500 mm, and 200 cm would be 2000 mm. That makes sense.\n\nI should make sure I'm not including extremes, just typical sizes. So maybe the minimum is around 1400 mm and the maximum around 2100 mm. But I'm not entirely sure if 2100 mm is typical or if that's on the taller side. Maybe 2000 mm is more standard as the upper limit.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at average data. For example, the average height for an adult human is about 172 cm for males and 158 cm for females. But the range would include people shorter and taller than that. So the minimum might be around 1450 mm (145 cm) and the maximum around 2100 mm (210 cm). That seems reasonable because 145 cm is about 4'9\" and 210 cm is about 6'11\", which covers a broad range but excludes the extremes like dwarfism or gigantism.\n\nI think that's a fair estimate.

I recall that heights can vary a bit more, maybe from about 1500 mm to 2000 mm when considering the full range of human adults. That would cover shorter and taller individuals. So, I should adjust the min and max to reflect that broader range.\n\nSo, the minimum size would be 1500 mm and the maximum would be 2000 mm.

Hmm, I know that the average height for adults varies, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact numbers. Let me think. \n\nI remember that the average height for an adult human is around 1.7 meters or so. But wait, that's meters, and the question asks for millimeters. So I need to convert that. There are 1000 millimeters in a meter, right? So 1.7 meters would be 1700 millimeters. But that's just the average. \n\nI should consider the range, not just the average. Typically, people can be shorter or taller than average. I think the average height for men is a bit higher than for women, but I'm not sure about the exact numbers. Maybe I should look for a general range that covers most adults. \n\nI've heard that the average height for an adult male is about 1.72 meters to 1.83 meters, but that's just a rough estimate. For women, it's a bit less, maybe around 1.58 meters to 1.68 meters. But I'm not certain if that's accurate or if it's based on specific data. \n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. The question is asking for the typical range size for a person's height, so I need to find the minimum and maximum heights that are considered typical. I think the minimum height for an adult would be around 1.3 meters, which is about 1300 millimeters. But that seems really short. Maybe I'm confusing meters and centimeters. Wait, 1.3 meters is 130 centimeters, which is 5 feet 3 inches. That's actually considered below average but still within the typical range for some populations. \n\nAs for the maximum, I know that some people can be quite tall. I think the average maximum height is around 1.95 meters or 195 centimeters, which is about 6 feet 5 inches. But again, that's an estimate. I'm not sure if that's the upper limit or if there are taller individuals. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the typical range is from about 1.5 meters (1500 mm) to 1.9 meters (1900 mm). That seems more reasonable because 1.5 meters is about 4 feet 11 inches, which is on the shorter side but still within the human range. 1.9 meters is about 6 feet 3 inches, which is tall but not unusually so. \n\nI think I've heard that the tallest person on record was over 2.7 meters, but that's extremely rare. So for the typical range, we can ignore the extremes and focus on what's common. So, I'll go with a minimum of 1500 mm and a maximum of 1900 mm. That should cover the vast majority of adults. \n\nBut wait, does this include children? The question specifies \"person,\" which is a human being, but doesn't specify age. If we include children, the minimum would be much lower, like newborns being around 500 mm. But I think the context implies adults because when people talk about the size of a person, they usually refer to adults unless specified otherwise. \n\nSo, to make it clear, I'll assume we're talking about adult humans. Therefore, the typical range would be from 1500 mm to 1900 mm. That seems to cover the average heights across different populations. I'm pretty confident with this range, but I might be missing some data from specific regions where average heights are different. However, for a general answer, this should suffice.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"min_size\": 1500.0,\n  \"max_size\": 1900.0\n}\n```"

Since it's about a person, I'm assuming it's the height, as that's a common measurement when talking about the size of a human being.\n\nNow, I know that average human heights vary, but I need to find the typical range.

For adults, the minimum height is around 130 cm, and the maximum is about 210 cm, though such extremes are rare.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for the typical range, not the absolute possible.

I've heard that the shortest adults are usually around 130 cm to 140 cm, but maybe I should go a bit lower to cover most cases. Let's say the minimum is about 1000 mm, which is 100 cm.

I think the average minimum for an adult is more like 145 cm, but to be inclusive, I'll keep it at 1000 mm to account for all possible adults, even if they're on the shorter side.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the min_size is 1000.0 mm and the max_size is 2200.0 mm.

That seems reasonable because it covers a broad range of human heights without going into extreme cases, which are less common.\n\nSo, converting these to millimeters:\n- Minimum size: 1.5 meters * 1000 = 1500 mm\n- Maximum size: 1.95 meters * 1000 = 1950 mm\n\nI should make sure these values are in float format as per the JSON requirement. Also, I need to present only the JSON without any additional text or explanation since the user specified that.\n\nWait, just to double-check, is 1.5 meters the lower end for adults? I think so, as anything below that might be considered below average but still within the typical range. Similarly, 1.95 meters is about 6 feet 5 inches, which is on the taller side but still common enough to be included.\n\nI don't think I need to account for children or infants here because the concept is about a person, which generally refers to adults. If it were about all humans regardless of age, the range would be much larger, starting from newborns. But the user specifically mentioned \"person,\" which I'm interpreting as adults.\n\nSo, to summarize, the typical height range in millimeters for a person is from 1500 mm to 1950 mm. I'll structure this into a JSON object with min_size and max_size as keys.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"min_size\": 1500.0,\n  \"max_size\": 1950.0\n}\n```"

I remember that men are generally taller than women. \n\nI think the average height for an adult male is around 172 cm, and for an adult female, it's about 159 cm. But wait, these are just averages. The range would be broader. I should consider the minimum and maximum possible heights.\n\nThe smallest adult in the world, according to Guinness World Records, was He Pingping, who stood at 74.6 cm. On the taller side, Robert Wadlow was the tallest man, standing at 272.6 cm. So, those are the extremes, but maybe the typical range is a bit narrower.\n\nHowever, in general, the typical height range for adults is usually considered from about 150 cm to 193 cm. That seems to cover most adults, excluding the extreme cases. But since the user asked for the typical range, including the extremes might be necessary.\n\nWait, but if I include the absolute minimum and maximum, then the range would be from about 75 cm to 273 cm. But that's including the record holders, which are rare. Maybe the typical range is a bit narrower, say from 150 cm to 193 cm, but the user didn't specify excluding extremes.\n\nI think it's safer to include the absolute minimum and maximum to cover all possible human heights, even if they're rare. So, converting those to millimeters: 746 mm and 2726 mm.\n\nI should structure this as a JSON object with min_size and max_size keys. So, the final JSON would be:\n{\n  \"min_size\": 746.0,\n  \"max_size\": 2726.0\n}\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"min_size\": 1500.0,\n  \"max_size\": 1930.0\n}\n```"

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what they mean by \"size.\" Since it's measured in millimeters, I'm assuming they're referring to height. That makes sense because height is a common measurement for people.\n\nNow, I should consider the average height range for humans. I remember that the average height for adults varies by gender. Men are generally taller than women, but I need a general range that covers both.\n\nI think the typical height range for adults is from about 1.5 meters to 1.9 meters. That's 1500 mm to 1900 mm. But wait, does this include children and the elderly? Maybe, but the user didn't specify age, so I'll stick with adults as a standard.\n\nLet me double-check these numbers. Yes, 1.5 meters is about 4 feet 11 inches, and 1.9 meters is around 6 feet 3 inches. That seems reasonable as a typical range, covering most adults.\n\nI should make sure the units are correct. Since they asked for millimeters, I'll convert meters to mm by multiplying by 1000. So, 1500 mm and 1900 mm.\n\nI need to format this as JSON with min_size and max_size as keys. No additional information is needed, just the JSON structure.\n\nWait, should I consider any other factors? Maybe extreme cases, but the user asked for typical ranges, so sticking with the average is better.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it.

The user wants this information in a JSON format with min_size and max_size as keys. \n\nFirst, I should understand what \"size\" refers to here. Since the context is about a person, it's likely referring to height. People vary in height, so I should consider average heights for adults and account for the range from the shortest to the tallest.\n\nI know that the average height for an adult human is around 1.7 meters, but that's just an average. To find the range, I should look at the minimum and maximum heights. I remember that the shortest recorded adult height is around 54.6 cm, and the tallest is about 272.6 cm, but these are extreme cases.\n\nWait, but maybe the user is looking for a more typical range rather than the absolute extremes. So, perhaps considering the range from about 1.5 meters to 2 meters would cover most adults. Converting that to millimeters, since 1 meter is 1000 mm, 1.5 meters is 1500 mm and 2 meters is 2000 mm. \n\nBut to be more precise, maybe the minimum is slightly less and the maximum a bit more. I've heard that some sources use 1400 mm to 2100 mm as a range. That would cover from about 1.4 meters to 2.1 meters, which seems reasonable, including most adults while excluding the extreme outliers.\n\nSo, I'll structure the JSON with min_size as 1400.0 and max_size as 2100.0.

First, I should understand what \"size\" refers to here. It's probably the height since that's a common measurement for people.\n\nI know that average human height varies, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact range. Let me think. For adults, the average height is around 170-180 cm, but that's just an average. The range is broader. I remember hearing that the shortest adult in the world was around 50 cm, and the tallest was over 200 cm. Wait, no, that's probably in centimeters. So I need to convert that to millimeters.\n\nWait, no, the user is asking for the range in millimeters, so I need to make sure I convert from centimeters to millimeters correctly. 1 meter is 100 cm, and 1 cm is 10 mm. So, 1 m is 1000 mm.\n\nSo, if the shortest person was about 50 cm, that's 500 mm. And the tallest was maybe 250 cm, which is 2500 mm. But wait, I'm not sure if 250 cm is accurate. I think the tallest recorded person was around 272 cm, which would be 2720 mm. But maybe I should use a more general range. Let me check my facts.\n\nI think the average height for an adult is about 175 cm, but the range is from about 130 cm to 200 cm, maybe even a bit more. So, converting that to mm, 130 cm is 1300 mm, and 200 cm is 2000 mm. But wait, I thought the shortest person was around 50 cm, which is 500 mm. So maybe the min is lower.\n\nBut perhaps the user is considering adult humans. So, maybe the range is from 1500 mm to 2000 mm. That seems reasonable. Wait, no, 150 cm is 1500 mm, which is 5 feet. That's on the shorter side for adults, but possible. The tallest, as I recall, was Robert Wadlow, who was 272 cm, so 2720 mm. But maybe the max should be a bit lower to be more general.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants the range from the smallest possible human height to the tallest. So, the min could be around 500 mm (50 cm) for the shortest person, and the max around 2720 mm for the tallest. That seems more accurate.\n\nSo, putting it together, the min_size would be 500.0 and the max_size would be 2720.0. But I'm not 100% sure if the min is 500 mm. I think the shortest recorded adult was about 50 cm, so that's 500 mm. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI should double-check the conversion: 1 cm = 10 mm, so 50 cm = 500 mm and 272 cm = 2720 mm. Yep, that makes sense. So the JSON would have min_size as 500.0 and max_size as 2720.0.\n</think>\n\n**JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"min_size\": 500.0,\n  \"max_size\": 2720.0\n}\n```"

The user is asking for the size range of a person, measured in millimeters, and they want it in a JSON format with min_size and max_size as keys.\n\nFirst, I should clarify what \"size\" refers to here. It could be height, width, or maybe even weight, but since the unit is millimeters, it's more likely to be a measurement of height or perhaps the overall dimensions. Given that, I'll assume they're asking about height.\n\nNow, I know that the average height for adults varies, but I should find the typical range. For adults, the average height is around 1.7 to 1.8 meters, but that's meters. Converting that to millimeters would be 1700 mm to 1800 mm. But wait, that's just an average. The range would be broader.\n\nLooking at human height, the typical range for adults is generally from about 150 cm to 190 cm. That's 1.5 meters to 1.9 meters. Converting that to millimeters, that's 1500 mm to 1900 mm. But I should check if that's accurate.\n\nI recall that the smallest adults, like those with dwarfism, can be around 50 cm, which is 500 mm. On the taller side, the tallest humans can reach over 200 cm, so 2000 mm. So the range from 500 mm to 2500 mm might be more accurate, but that's quite a broad range.\n\nHowever, in most cases, the average adult is between 1500 mm and 1900 mm. Including children would lower the minimum, but if we're talking about persons in general, including all ages, the minimum could be as low as 500 mm for infants, but that's probably too young. Maybe the range from 500 mm to 2500 mm is acceptable, but perhaps it's better to stick with adults unless specified otherwise.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"person (which is a human being)\", so it's general. So including all ages. The smallest human would be a newborn, but that's around 500 mm in height. The tallest person ever recorded was over 2700 mm, but that's an extreme case. So perhaps the max size should be around 2500 mm to account for very tall individuals.\n\nBut maybe I should stick to a more typical range. For adults, 1500 mm to 1900 mm is common. Including children, the range would be from about 500 mm (newborn) to 1900 mm. But that's a wide range. Alternatively, if the user is referring to adults, 1500 to 1900 mm is better.\n\nI think I should provide a range that covers most adults, so min_size as 1500.0 and max_size as 1900.0. But wait, the user might expect the broader range including all ages. So perhaps I should go with 500.0 to 2500.0 to cover all possible human sizes.\n\nBut considering the context, maybe the user is referring to adults, so 1500 to 1900 is more appropriate. I should decide which one to go with. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps including the broader range is safer, but it's a bit unclear.\n\nAlternatively, I could provide the average adult range, which is 1500 to 1900 mm. I think that's the more likely expected answer. So I'll go with min_size: 1500.0 and max_size: 1900.0.\n</think>\n\n**JSON Response:**\n```json\n{\n  \"min_size\": 1500.0,\n  \"max_size\": 1900.0\n}\n```"

To convert that to millimeters, I know that 1 meter is 1000 millimeters, so 1 centimeter is 10 millimeters. Therefore, 170 cm would be 1700 mm, and 180 cm would be 1800 mm.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit narrow. Maybe I should consider a broader range to account for variations. Some people are shorter, like around 150 cm, which is 1500 mm, and others are taller, maybe up to 200 cm, which is 2000 mm. That seems more inclusive, covering most adults.\n\nI should double-check if 1500 mm is reasonable for the minimum. 150 cm is about 4 feet 11 inches, which is on the shorter side but still within the typical range for adults. On the taller end, 200 cm is about 6 feet 7 inches, which is quite tall but still possible.
