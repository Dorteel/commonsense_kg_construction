    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out which properties are relevant descriptors for a refrigerator. Let me start by understanding the concept. A refrigerator is a white goods appliance used to store food at low temperatures. So, the main function is to keep things cold.\n\nLooking at the list of candidate properties: colour, shape, location, texture, material, scenario, pattern, context, disposition, function, size, weight, temperature, value.\n\nFirst, I'll consider each property one by one.\n\nColour: Refrigerators come in various colors, like white, stainless steel, black, etc. The color can affect the kitchen's aesthetics, so it's relevant. So, colour should be true.\n\nShape: The shape of a refrigerator is important because it has to fit into a specific space in the kitchen. They usually have a standard shape, but sometimes they can be more compact or have different designs. So, shape is relevant. True.\n\nLocation: Where the refrigerator is placed matters. It's usually in the kitchen, but sometimes in other areas. Location helps in understanding its use context. So, location is always relevant across concepts, but in this case, it's specifically about placement in a kitchen. Still, it's a universally relevant property, so true.\n\nTexture: The surface texture might not be as crucial for functionality, but it can affect the appearance and ease of cleaning. However, compared to other properties like function or temperature, it's less critical. So, maybe false.\n\nMaterial: The material is important because it affects durability and energy efficiency. For example, some refrigerators have better insulation materials. So, material is relevant. True.\n\nScenario: This refers to the situations in which the refrigerator is used, like home, commercial, or specific events. It helps in understanding its application, so scenario is relevant. True.\n\nPattern: This might refer to design patterns on the surface. While it can be a part of the aesthetic, it's not a fundamental descriptor for a refrigerator's function. So, probably false.\n\nContext: This is always relevant because it provides background information on how and where the refrigerator is used. So, true.\n\nDisposition: This refers to the arrangement or state of the refrigerator. It might not be as critical as other properties, but in some contexts, how it's set up could matter. However, I'm not sure if it's a key descriptor. Maybe false.\n\nFunction: This is crucial. The primary function of a refrigerator is to keep food at low temperatures. Without understanding its function, we can't really characterize it. So, true.\n\nSize: The size is important because it determines how much can be stored and where it can fit. So, size is definitely relevant. True.\n\nWeight: While weight might be a factor for installation or moving, it's not as critical for characterizing the refrigerator's purpose. So, maybe false.\n\nTemperature: This is essential because refrigerators are defined by their ability to maintain low temperatures. So, true.\n\nValue: This could refer to both monetary value and the importance of the refrigerator in preserving food. It's a relevant descriptor because it speaks to the refrigerator's worth. So, true.\n\nI think I've gone through each property. Now, I'll summarize which ones are relevant and why.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"concept\": \"refrigerator\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Refrigerators come in various colours which can affect the kitchen's aesthetics.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The shape determines how it fits into kitchen spaces.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is always relevant as it helps contextualize the presence or use of any object.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Texture is less critical compared to other properties like function or temperature.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Material affects durability and energy efficiency.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario helps in understanding its application context.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Pattern is not a fundamental descriptor for functionality.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Context is always relevant for understanding usage and background.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition is not a key descriptor for a refrigerator.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Function is crucial as it defines the refrigerator's purpose.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Size determines storage capacity and spatial fit.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight is less critical for characterizing purpose.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature is essential for its primary function.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Value refers to both monetary worth and importance in food preservation.\"\n  }\n}\n```"

The description given is that it's a white goods appliance used to store food at low temperatures. So, I need to go through each candidate property and decide if it's relevant.\n\nFirst, colour. Refrigerators come in various colors, but typically, they are white, which is why they're called white goods. Color can help characterize the refrigerator, so I think colour is relevant.\n\nNext, shape. The shape of a refrigerator is pretty standardâ€”usually a boxy form. But knowing the shape might help distinguish it from other appliances, so shape is relevant.\n\nLocation is always important because where you place a refrigerator matters. It's usually in the kitchen, but knowing the location helps in understanding its use. So, location is a relevant descriptor.\n\nTexture might not be as crucial. While the exterior can have different finishes, texture isn't a primary way to characterize a refrigerator. So, I'm leaning towards texture not being relevant.\n\nMaterial is important because refrigerators are made of materials like metal and plastic, which affect their durability and function. So, material is relevant.\n\nScenario refers to the situations in which the refrigerator is used. Since it's used in everyday life for food storage, scenario is relevant.\n\nPattern might not be as important. While some refrigerators might have designs, it's not a key descriptor. So, pattern isn't relevant.\n\nContext is always relevant because it helps understand the refrigerator's purpose and environment. So, context is a yes.\n\nDisposition isn't really applicable here. It's more about the object's state, which isn't a primary descriptor. So, disposition isn't relevant.\n\nFunction is crucial because the main purpose of a refrigerator is to keep things cool. So, function is definitely relevant.\n\nSize matters because refrigerators come in different sizes, and that affects where they can be placed and how much they can store. So, size is relevant.\n\nWeight is important for installation and moving the appliance, so it's a relevant descriptor.\n\nTemperature is key because refrigerators operate at low temperatures to preserve food. So, temperature is definitely relevant.\n\nValue is always relevant because it pertains to the cost or worth of the refrigerator. So, value is a yes.\n\nI think I've covered all the properties. Now, I'll structure this into a JSON object as specified, making sure each property has a value and reason.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"concept\": \"refrigerator\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Refrigerators are often white, hence called white goods, making colour a relevant descriptor.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The shape helps distinguish it from other appliances, typically boxy.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is always relevant for contextualizing use and presence.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Texture isn't a primary way to characterize a refrigerator.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Material affects durability and function, making it relevant.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario is relevant as it's used in everyday life for food storage.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Pattern isn't a key descriptor for a refrigerator.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Context helps understand the purpose and environment of the refrigerator.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition isn't a primary descriptor for this concept.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Function is crucial as it defines the refrigerator's purpose.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Size affects placement and storage capacity, making it relevant.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight is important for installation and moving the appliance.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature is key for preserving food, a primary function.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Value is always relevant regarding cost or worth.\"\n  }\n}\n```"

The concept given is a refrigerator, which is described as a white goods appliance used for storing food at low temperatures.

The candidate properties are: colour, shape, location, texture, material, scenario, pattern, context, disposition, function, size, weight, temperature, and value.\n\nStarting with \"colour\": Refrigerators come in various colors, but the most common is white, hence the term \"white goods.\" However, color can vary, so it might help in identifying the product or matching home decor. But is color a key descriptor? Maybe not the most critical, but it can be relevant in certain contexts.\n\nNext, \"shape\": Refrigerators are typically boxy, but shapes can vary slightly, like side-by-side or French door models. Shape affects where it can be placed, so it's somewhat relevant.\n\n\"Location\" is always relevant because it tells us where the refrigerator is used or placed, which is universally applicable.\n\n\"Texture\" refers to the surface feel. Most refrigerators have a smooth texture, but some might have different finishes.

It might refer to the context in which the refrigerator is used, like home or commercial settings. While it's somewhat relevant, it's more about context than a direct descriptor.\n\n\"Pattern\" doesn't seem very relevant. Refrigerators don't typically have patterns; they're more about color and shape.\n\n\"Context\" is always relevant as it provides the setting or background, which is universally important.\n\n\"Disposition\" is about the arrangement or placement. It's somewhat relevant but maybe not as crucial as others.\n\n\"Function\" is definitely relevant.

The concept given is that a refrigerator is a white goods appliance used to store food at low temperatures. I need to go through each candidate property and decide if it's a relevant descriptor. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the properties: colour, shape, location, texture, material, scenario, pattern, context, disposition, function, size, weight, temperature, and value.\n\nStarting with colour. Refrigerators do come in various colours, and while the classic is white, they can be stainless steel, black, etc. Colour might help in choosing a refrigerator that matches kitchen decor, so I think colour is relevant.\n\nNext is shape. Refrigerators have different shapes like standard, side-by-side, French door, etc. The shape affects where and how it's used, so shape is definitely a relevant descriptor.\n\nLocation is important because where the refrigerator is placed in a kitchen affects usability. It's a universally relevant property as knowing where something is located is always useful.\n\nTexture might refer to the exterior finish, like smooth or textured surfaces. This could be relevant for maintenance or aesthetic purposes, so I think texture is important.\n\nMaterial is crucial because refrigerators are made from materials like metal or plastic, which affect durability and energy efficiency. So material is definitely relevant.\n\nScenario refers to the typical situations where the refrigerator is used, like home kitchens or commercial settings. This helps understand its application, so scenario is relevant.\n\nPattern might refer to any design on the refrigerator, but most are plain. However, some might have patterns, so it's not as universally applicable. I'm not sure if pattern is that relevant here.\n\nContext is about the circumstances surrounding the use of the refrigerator, which is always relevant because it explains why and how it's used.\n\nDisposition is about the arrangement or placement, which ties into location and how the refrigerator is set up in a space. So it's somewhat relevant.\n\nFunction is absolutely key. The primary function of a refrigerator is to keep food cold, so this is definitely a relevant descriptor.\n\nSize matters because it determines how much can be stored and where it can fit. Size is always relevant for appliances.\n\nWeight is important for installation and moving the appliance, so it's relevant.\n\nTemperature is central to a refrigerator's function. It's used to store food at low temperatures, so this is highly relevant.\n\nValue could refer to both monetary worth and the importance of the refrigerator in preserving food. It's a bit abstract, but I think it's relevant in terms of its utility.\n\nSo, going through each property, I think colour, shape, location, texture, material, scenario, context, disposition, function, size, weight, temperature, and value are all relevant. Pattern is the only one that might not be as relevant because refrigerators typically don't have patterns, but I'm not entirely sure.

The concept given is a refrigerator, which is described as a white goods appliance used to store food at low temperatures. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each candidate property and decide if it's relevant. \n\nStarting with \"colour\": Refrigerators come in various colors, but the color doesn't really affect its function. However, in marketing and aesthetics, color is important for consumers. So, I think it's somewhat relevant.\n\nNext, \"shape\": The shape of a refrigerator is pretty standardâ€”usually a box shape. But different models might have slight variations, so shape can help distinguish between types or sizes. I think it's relevant.\n\n\"Location\" is about where the refrigerator is placed. Since refrigerators are typically in the kitchen, knowing the location helps understand their use. Location is always relevant for any object, so this should definitely be included.\n\n\"Texture\" refers to the surface feel. Most refrigerators have a smooth texture, but some might have different finishes. While it's not the most critical factor, it does contribute to the overall design and user experience. So, I'll mark it as relevant.\n\n\"Material\" is important because refrigerators are made from materials like metal and plastic. The material affects durability and energy efficiency, so this is definitely relevant.\n\n\"Scenario\" refers to the situations in which the refrigerator is used. Since it's used in everyday life for food storage, scenario is relevant as it explains its purpose.\n\n\"Pattern\" doesn't seem very relevant because refrigerators usually don't have intricate patterns; they're more about solid colors or simple designs.\n\n\"Context\" is about the circumstances surrounding the refrigerator's use. This is universally relevant because understanding the context helps in knowing how and why the refrigerator is used.\n\n\"Disposition\" relates to the arrangement or placement. While it's somewhat related to location, it's more about how the parts are arranged inside, which might not be as crucial. So, I'm leaning towards it not being very relevant.\n\n\"Function\" is crucial because the main purpose of a refrigerator is to keep food cold. This is definitely a key descriptor.\n\n\"Size\" matters because refrigerators come in different sizes to fit various spaces and needs. This is relevant.\n\n\"Weight\" is less important unless we're talking about moving it, but generally, it's not a primary concern for users. So, I don't think it's very relevant.\n\n\"Temperature\" is essential because the primary function of a refrigerator is to maintain low temperatures. This is definitely relevant.\n\n\"Value\" refers to the worth or price. While important for purchasing decisions, it's not a descriptor that characterizes the refrigerator itself. So, I don't think it's a relevant descriptor in this context.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll go through each property and assign a boolean value and a reason. For the always-relevant properties like location and context, I'll note that they are universally applicable.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"concept\": \"refrigerator\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Colour can influence consumer choice and aesthetic preferences.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Shape helps distinguish between different models and sizes.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is always relevant as it contextualizes the use of the refrigerator.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Texture contributes to the design and user experience.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Material affects durability and energy efficiency.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario explains the purpose and usage of the refrigerator.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Pattern is not a key descriptor for refrigerators.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Context is universally relevant for understanding use and purpose.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition is less critical compared to other properties.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Function is crucial as it defines the refrigerator's purpose.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Size is important for spatial and capacity needs.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight is not a primary concern for users.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature is essential for the refrigerator's function.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Value is not a descriptor of the refrigerator itself.\"\n  }\n}\n```"

So, the concept is a refrigerator, which is described as a white goods appliance used for storing food at low temperatures. I need to go through each candidate property and decide whether it's relevant or not, and provide a reason for each.\n\nStarting with the first property: colour. Refrigerators come in various colors, like white, stainless steel, black, etc. The color can affect the kitchen's aesthetics, so it's a relevant descriptor because it helps characterize the refrigerator's appearance.\n\nNext is shape. Most refrigerators have a standard shape, but some are more compact or have different designs like French doors. The shape can influence where and how it's used, so it's relevant.\n\nLocation is important because where the refrigerator is placed in the kitchen can affect its functionality and usability. So, location is universally relevant for understanding context.\n\nTexture might not be as crucial. While the exterior can have different textures, like smooth or brushed, it's not a primary descriptor for a refrigerator's function or identification.\n\nMaterial is relevant because refrigerators are made from materials like metal or plastic, which can affect durability and energy efficiency.\n\nScenario is more about the context in which the refrigerator is used. Since it's a household appliance, the scenario helps understand its purpose, so it's relevant.\n\nPattern isn't really applicable here. Refrigerators don't typically have patterns; they're more about color and shape.\n\nContext is universally relevant because it helps understand how and where the refrigerator is used, which is important for any concept.\n\nDisposition isn't really applicable. It's more about the attitude or orientation, which doesn't describe the refrigerator itself.\n\nFunction is definitely relevant because the primary purpose of a refrigerator is to keep food cold, which is essential for its description.\n\nSize is important because it determines the space it occupies and the amount of food it can store.\n\nWeight is less relevant unless we're talking about moving it, but it's not a primary descriptor for understanding the refrigerator's purpose.\n\nTemperature is crucial because refrigerators are defined by their ability to maintain low temperatures, so it's a key descriptor.\n\nValue is universally relevant as it provides economic context, which is important for any product.\n\nPutting it all together, I need to mark each property as true or false and provide a reason.

Color can affect the appliance's appearance in a kitchen, so it's somewhat relevant, but maybe not the most crucial factor.\n\n\"Shape\": Refrigerators have specific shapes, usually boxy with doors. The shape is important for fitting into kitchens and for functionality, like having shelves and compartments. So shape is relevant.\n\n\"Location\": Where a refrigerator is placed is important because it's typically in the kitchen. Location is a universal property since knowing where something is used or found is always relevant.\n\n\"Texture\": This refers to the surface feel. While some refrigerators have smooth surfaces and others might have textured finishes, texture isn't a primary descriptor for understanding what a refrigerator is or how it functions.\n\n\"Material\": Refrigerators are made from materials like metal, plastic, and insulation.

It's very relevant.\n\nSize: The size determines where it can fit and how much it can hold. It's a key factor in choosing a refrigerator.\n\nWeight: While important for installation, it's less about characterization.

    "response": "<think>\nAlright, so I've been given this task where I need to figure out which properties are relevant descriptors for a refrigerator. The concept is described as a white goods appliance used for storing food at low temperatures. The list of candidate properties includes color, shape, location, texture, material, scenario, pattern, context, disposition, function, size, weight, temperature, and value.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a relevant descriptor is. It's a property that helps characterize, distinguish, or understand the concept. So, I should go through each property and decide if it's relevant for a refrigerator.\n\nStarting with color. Refrigerators come in various colors, which can affect their appearance in a kitchen. So color is probably relevant.\n\nShape is next. The shape of a refrigerator is important because it affects where it can be placed and how it fits into a kitchen layout. So shape should be relevant.\n\nLocation is always important because it tells us where something is used or found. For a refrigerator, knowing it's typically in a kitchen makes sense.\n\nTexture might be relevant because the surface finish (like stainless steel or matte) can affect its appearance and maintenance.\n\nMaterial is important because refrigerators are made of materials like metal and plastic, which affect durability and energy efficiency.\n\nScenario isn't as clear. I think it refers to the situation in which the refrigerator is used, which might not be as universally relevant as others.\n\nPattern doesn't seem relevant because refrigerators usually don't have patterns; they're more about solid colors or metallic finishes.\n\nContext is a bit vague, but I think it's about the surroundings, which is somewhat relevant but maybe not as crucial as others.\n\nDisposition isn't clear here. It might refer to the arrangement or attitude, which doesn't seem directly relevant.\n\nFunction is definitely relevant because the primary purpose of a refrigerator is to keep things cool.\n\nSize is important because it determines how much can be stored and where it can fit.\n\nWeight is less relevant because, while it's a physical property, it's not something people usually focus on when discussing refrigerators.\n\nTemperature is crucial because maintaining the right temperature is the main function.\n\nValue is about worth, which can be relevant in terms of cost or energy efficiency.\n\nSo, considering all these, I'll mark each property as true or false based on relevance and provide a reason for each.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"concept\": \"refrigerator\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Refrigerators come in various colours which can affect their appearance and fit in different kitchen designs.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The shape determines the space it occupies and its fit in various kitchen layouts.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is always relevant as it helps contextualize where the refrigerator is used or found.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Texture affects the appearance and maintenance, such as stainless steel or matte finishes.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Material affects durability and energy efficiency, important for appliance performance.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario is not universally relevant for characterizing a refrigerator.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Refrigerators typically don't have patterns, focusing more on solid colors or finishes.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Context is less crucial compared to other properties for understanding a refrigerator.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition is not directly relevant to the characterization of a refrigerator.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Function is crucial as it defines the purpose of a refrigerator.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Size determines storage capacity and spatial fit in a kitchen.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight is less relevant for typical discussions about refrigerators.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature is essential as it's the primary function of a refrigerator.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Value relates to cost and energy efficiency, important for consumers.\"\n  }\n}\n```"

    "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which properties are relevant descriptors for a refrigerator. The concept given is that a refrigerator is a white goods appliance used to store food at low temperatures. I have a list of candidate properties, and I need to determine which ones are relevant. \n\nFirst, I should go through each property one by one and think about whether it helps characterize or distinguish a refrigerator in everyday or expert knowledge.\n\nStarting with \"colour\": Refrigerators come in various colors, and while the color might influence someone's purchasing decision for aesthetic reasons, it doesn't fundamentally characterize what a refrigerator is or does. So maybe color isn't that crucial as a descriptor.\n\nNext, \"shape\": The shape of a refrigerator is important because it's designed to fit into specific spaces in a kitchen. The shape affects its functionality and where it can be placed, so shape is relevant.\n\n\"Location\" is always relevant because it tells us where the refrigerator is used or found. For example, it's typically in the kitchen, which is an important context.\n\n\"Texture\" might refer to the finish or material on the outside. While it can affect the appearance and maybe the ease of cleaning, it doesn't directly relate to the function or primary characteristics of a refrigerator. So texture might not be a key descriptor.\n\n\"Material\" is about what the refrigerator is made of. This is important because it affects durability, energy efficiency, and safety. So material is a relevant descriptor.\n\n\"Scenario\" refers to the situations in which the refrigerator is used. Since refrigerators are used in everyday life for food storage, scenario is relevant as it explains their typical use cases.\n\n\"Pattern\" might refer to any designs on the refrigerator. Like color, this is more about aesthetics and not a fundamental characteristic of its function, so probably not a relevant descriptor.\n\n\"Context\" is always relevant because it provides background information, like the kitchen environment, which is essential for understanding the refrigerator's role.\n\n\"Disposition\" refers to the arrangement or placement. While it's somewhat related to location, it's more about how the refrigerator is situated within a space, which can influence its functionality. So disposition might be relevant.\n\n\"Function\" is definitely relevant because the primary purpose of a refrigerator is to keep things cool, which is its main function.\n\n\"Size\" is important because it determines how much can be stored and where it can fit, so size is a key descriptor.\n\n\"Weight\" might be relevant for installation or moving the appliance, but it's not as crucial for characterizing the refrigerator's main purpose.\n\n\"Temperature\" is essential because maintaining low temperatures is the core function of a refrigerator.\n\n\"Value\" could refer to its monetary worth or energy efficiency. Both are important for consumers, so value is a relevant descriptor.\n\nNow, considering always-relevant properties like location and context, they apply to all concepts. So I should mark those as true with explanations that they're universally relevant.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll go through each property, decide if it's relevant, and provide a brief reason for each.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"concept\": \"refrigerator\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Colour is not a fundamental descriptor as it doesn't affect the primary function.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Shape determines spatial fit and functionality in a kitchen.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is always relevant as it contextualizes the refrigerator's use.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Texture affects aesthetics and maintenance but not core function.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Material affects durability, efficiency, and safety.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario explains typical use cases in daily life.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Pattern relates to design, not fundamental characteristics.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Context is universally relevant for understanding environment and role.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition affects functionality and spatial arrangement.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Function is core to the refrigerator's purpose.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Size determines storage capacity and spatial fit.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight is less crucial for primary characterization.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature is essential for the refrigerator's core function.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Value is relevant for monetary and energy efficiency considerations.\"\n  }\n}\n```"
