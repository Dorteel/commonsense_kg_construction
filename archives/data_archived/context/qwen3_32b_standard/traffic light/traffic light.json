    "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The concept is a traffic light, which is a visual signal controlling traffic at intersections. The candidate properties are color, shape, location, texture, material, scenario, pattern, context, disposition, function, size, weight, temperature, value.\n\nFirst, color is definitely important. Traffic lights use specific colors like red, yellow, and green to signal different actions. So color is relevant.\n\nShape might matter too. Traffic lights typically have a vertical or horizontal arrangement of lights. Their shape helps in identifying them from other lights. So shape is true.\n\nLocation is always a relevant property for any object, as it tells where the traffic light is situated, which intersection it controls. So location is true and the reason is universal.\n\nTexture and material seem less important. The texture of a traffic light isn't something people usually consider when understanding its function. Similarly, the material (like metal or plastic) doesn't affect how it controls traffic. So both are false.\n\nScenario and context might be tricky. Scenario could refer to the situations where the traffic light operates, but that's more about usage than the properties of the light itself. Context is a bit vague here. I think scenario is false, context is false unless it's about the surrounding environment, but maybe not a core descriptor.\n\nPattern could refer to the sequence of lights (like red then green), which is part of its function. But the pattern here is more about the sequence, which is part of the function. So pattern might be true. Or maybe pattern refers to physical arrangement, but shape already covers that. Hmm. Maybe pattern is false.\n\nFunction is definitely true. The primary purpose of a traffic light is to control traffic flow, so function is a key descriptor.\n\nSize and weight are not critical for understanding its function. You don't need to know the size to know how it works. So false.\n\nTemperature and value are irrelevant. Traffic light's temperature doesn't affect its operation, and value is subjective. So both false.\n\nDisposition isn't a common term here. Maybe it refers to the state (like on or off), but that's more about function. So false.\n\nPutting it all together, the relevant properties are color, shape, location, function, context (maybe?), pattern (uncertain). Wait, let me check again. The description says \"visual signal to control the flow of traffic at intersections.\" So function is definitely true. Pattern might refer to the sequence of lights, which is part of the function. Maybe pattern is redundant here. But if pattern refers to the physical arrangement (like three lights in a vertical column), then shape covers that. So pattern is false.\n\nContext could be relevant because the traffic light operates in a specific context, like urban areas versus highways. But maybe that's part of location. The question is whether context is a relevant descriptor. I think context is more about the surrounding circumstances, but for the object itself, context isn't a core property. So context is false.\n\nSo final list:\n\ncolor: true (essential for signaling)\nshape: true (distinctive vertical/horizontal)\nlocation: true (universal)\nfunction: true (core purpose)\nothers: false\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"concept\": \"traffic light\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Traffic lights use specific colors (red, yellow, green) to communicate instructions to drivers and pedestrians.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The vertical or horizontal arrangement of lights is a distinguishing feature of traffic lights.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is always relevant as it helps contextualize the presence or use of any object.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Texture does not significantly contribute to understanding the function or identity of a traffic light.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Material composition is not a defining or distinguishing characteristic of traffic lights.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario is not a standard property for describing physical objects like traffic lights.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"While traffic lights operate in sequences, 'pattern' is not a direct property but rather a behavior or function.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Context is not a core physical or functional property of a traffic light itself.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition is not a standard or meaningful descriptor for traffic lights.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The primary purpose of a traffic light is to control traffic flow, making function a critical descriptor.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Size does not fundamentally characterize or distinguish traffic lights from other similar objects.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight is irrelevant to the conceptual understanding or functional role of a traffic light.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature does not affect the definition or operation of a traffic light in a meaningful way.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Monetary or subjective value is not a standard property for describing traffic lights.\"\n  }\n}"

Traffic lights use red, yellow, and green to signal different actions. So color should be true.\n\nShape is also key. They're usually vertical or horizontal with three lights. The shape helps identify them as traffic lights. So shape is true.\n\nLocation is always relevant, right? Where the traffic light is placed affects traffic flow. So location is true.\n\nTexture? Not sure. Traffic lights are smooth, but texture doesn't really matter in their function. Probably not relevant. False.\n\nMaterial? Maybe. They're made of durable materials to withstand weather, but material isn't as critical as other properties. Not sure. Maybe false unless specified.\n\nScenario? That's vague. Maybe the context in which they're used, but scenario isn't a standard descriptor. Probably false.\n\nPattern? Traffic lights have a specific sequence of lights. The pattern of their operation is important. Wait, but the candidate property is \"pattern\" as a physical descriptor. Hmm. The lights themselves have a vertical or horizontal pattern. So maybe true. Or is it more about the sequence? The question is about properties that characterize the object. If pattern refers to the arrangement of the lights (like vertical or horizontal), then true. But if it's about the timing, maybe not. Let's say true.\n\nContext? Like the environment where it's placed. Maybe, but similar to location. Not sure. Context is a bit broad. Maybe false unless it's about the usage context. Hmm, but the description says it's a visual signal to control traffic, so context might relate to the situation it's used in. Not sure.

The candidate properties are color, shape, location, texture, material, scenario, pattern, context, disposition, function, size, weight, temperature, value.\n\nFirst, I need to determine which of these are relevant descriptors. A relevant descriptor helps characterize or distinguish the concept. Let's go through each one.\n\nColor: Traffic lights use colors like red, yellow, green. Definitely relevant because they signal different actions. So value is true. Reason: Colors are essential for indicating stop, caution, go.\n\nShape: Traffic lights are usually vertical with three lights. The shape helps in identification. So true. Reason: Shape helps in distinguishing traffic lights from other signals.\n\nLocation: Where the traffic light is placed affects traffic control. Important for understanding its function. True. Reason: Location is always relevant as it contextualizes the object's use.\n\nTexture: Traffic lights are smooth, but texture isn't a key factor in their function. Probably not relevant. False. Reason: Texture doesn't affect the function or identification of a traffic light.\n\nMaterial: Made of glass or plastic, but material isn't crucial for understanding their role. Maybe not. False. Reason: Material isn't a primary descriptor for traffic lights' function.\n\nScenario: Not sure. Scenario might refer to the situation where it's used, but it's vague. Maybe not. False. Reason: Scenario is too broad and not a standard descriptor.\n\nPattern: The sequence of lights (red, yellow, green) is a pattern. But the property here is pattern, which could refer to design. Maybe the pattern of lights is part of the function. True? Hmm. Let's check. The pattern here might refer to the sequence, but the term is ambiguous. Maybe not. False. Reason: Pattern isn't a standard descriptor unless specified.\n\nContext: Where it's used, like urban areas. Contextual information is relevant. True. Reason: Context helps in understanding the application and environment of the traffic light.\n\nDisposition: Maybe refers to how it's placed (vertical or horizontal). But disposition isn't a common term here. False. Reason: Disposition isn't a standard property for traffic lights.\n\nFunction: Clearly relevant. Traffic light's function is to control traffic. True. Reason: Function is always relevant as it defines the purpose of the object.\n\nSize: The size can vary but affects visibility. Relevant. True. Reason: Size impacts effectiveness and visibility in controlling traffic.\n\nWeight: Not really relevant unless considering installation. False. Reason: Weight doesn't affect the function or identification of a traffic light.\n\nTemperature: Not related to function. False. Reason: Temperature isn't a factor in the operation of traffic lights.\n\nValue: Monetary value? Not relevant. False.

I need to determine which of the given properties are relevant descriptors.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the candidate properties: colour, shape, location, texture, material, scenario, pattern, context, disposition, function, size, weight, temperature, value.\n\nStarting with colour. Traffic lights are known for their distinct colors—red, yellow, green. So colour is definitely a key descriptor. Value: true. Reason: They use specific colors to indicate stop, caution, go.\n\nNext, shape. Traffic lights are typically vertical with three lights. The shape helps in identifying them. So shape is relevant. True.\n\nLocation is important because traffic lights are placed at intersections. Knowing where they are is crucial. But wait, location is always relevant? Maybe, but the instruction says to explain if it's always relevant. For traffic lights, location is essential as their placement defines their function. But according to the example, \"location is always relevant\". Hmm, but maybe in this context, it's more specific. Wait, the example says that for \"apple\", location is considered always relevant. So I should follow that. So for traffic light, location is true because it's always relevant.\n\nTexture? Traffic lights are smooth, but does texture matter? Probably not. Most people don't describe traffic lights by texture. False.\n\nMaterial. Traffic lights are made of materials like metal and plastic. But is material a key descriptor? Not really. Unless in an engineering context, but generally, material isn't a main property. False.\n\nScenario. Scenario refers to the situation or context in which the traffic light is used. But scenario might be too vague. Maybe not. False.\n\nPattern. Traffic lights have a pattern of lights (red on top, green at bottom). So pattern is relevant. True. The sequence and arrangement matter for their function.\n\nContext. Context is similar to scenario. It's a bit broad. Maybe traffic lights are in urban areas, but context isn't a primary descriptor. False. Also, the instruction says to mention if it's universally relevant. Since context isn't, it's false.\n\nDisposition. Disposition refers to the position or arrangement. Maybe similar to pattern. But disposition isn't a common term here. Not sure. Probably false.\n\nFunction. Traffic lights' main purpose is to control traffic. Function is definitely a key descriptor. True.\n\nSize. Traffic lights have standard sizes, but is size a key descriptor? Not as critical as color or function. However, size can vary, but it's not a primary characteristic. Maybe false. Wait, but the size might affect visibility. Hmm, but generally, the standard size is part of their design. But maybe not a primary descriptor. I'm a bit conflicted here. Let's say false unless specified otherwise.\n\nWeight. Not relevant for understanding or identifying a traffic light. False.\n\nTemperature. No, traffic lights don't operate based on temperature. False.\n\nValue. Value could refer to monetary value or something else. Not a standard descriptor. False.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- colour: true\n- shape: true\n- location: true (always relevant)\n- texture: false\n- material: false\n- scenario: false\n- pattern: true\n- context: false\n- disposition: false\n- function: true\n- size: maybe false\n- weight: false\n- temperature: false\n- value: false\n\nWait, the example for apple includes location as always relevant. So for traffic light, location's value is true because it's always relevant. But in the example, the reason is \"Location is always relevant...\". So I should follow that. So location's reason is that it's universally relevant.\n\nFor pattern, the reason would be that the sequence of lights (red, yellow, green) is crucial for their operation.\n\nFunction is definitely true because their purpose is central to their identity.\n\nShape is true because the vertical arrangement is standard.\n\nSize might be considered false because while they have standard sizes, it's not a primary descriptor for general understanding. Unless size affects function, which it does in terms of visibility, but I think the key properties are more about color, pattern, function, etc.\n\nSo the final JSON should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"concept\": \"traffic light\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Traffic lights use specific colors (red, yellow, green) to communicate commands to drivers and pedestrians.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The vertical arrangement of lights (red on top, green on bottom) is a standard shape that distinguishes traffic lights from other objects.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is always relevant as it helps contextualize the presence or use of any object.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Texture does not meaningfully characterize or distinguish traffic lights in common understanding.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Material is not a primary descriptor for understanding the function or identity of a traffic light.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario is too vague and not a standard property for describing traffic lights.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The sequence and arrangement of lights (e.g., red on top, green at bottom) define their operational logic.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Context is not a direct property of a traffic light itself but rather its environment, which is not intrinsic.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition is not a standard or meaningful descriptor for traffic lights.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The primary function of controlling traffic flow is central to the definition of a traffic light.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Size varies by design but is not a critical descriptor for general understanding or identification.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight is irrelevant to the conceptual understanding of a traffic light.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature does not affect the conceptual or functional definition of a traffic light.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Value (monetary or otherwise) is not a standard or meaningful descriptor for traffic lights.\"\n  }\n}"

The reason would be that the colors are essential for their function and user interaction.\n\nNext, shape: Traffic lights are typically vertical with three lights. The shape helps in recognizing them and distinguishing from other lights. So, shape is relevant because it's a standard feature that users rely on.\n\nLocation: Where a traffic light is placed is critical. They are installed at intersections, roundabouts, etc. Location helps in understanding their placement and function. Since location is always relevant for any object's context, it's a yes here.\n\nTexture: Texture refers to the surface feel. Traffic lights are made of smooth materials, but texture isn't something people usually consider when identifying or understanding their function. So, probably not relevant.\n\nMaterial: The material (like plastic, metal) might affect durability, but not the primary function or identification. Unless specified, material isn't a key descriptor for understanding a traffic light's role. So, maybe false.\n\nScenario: Scenario refers to the situation where the traffic light is used. However, traffic lights are used in traffic control scenarios by default. The term is vague here, so scenario might not add specific info. Not relevant.\n\nPattern: The sequence of lights (red, yellow, green) is a pattern. This is crucial as the pattern dictates traffic flow. So pattern is relevant because it's part of their operation.\n\nContext: Context is similar to location but broader. Traffic lights are used in urban contexts, but context is a bit broad here. Maybe not as specific as location. However, context can help in understanding their use. But since location is already included and context is more general, maybe not. Hmm. Need to check if context adds anything. Since the description mentions controlling traffic at intersections, the context is inherently about traffic control. So context might be relevant here. Wait, the user says context is a candidate. Let's think: context could refer to the surrounding environment. But maybe traffic lights' context is their role in traffic control, which is part of their function. So context might not be a separate relevant descriptor. So maybe false.\n\nDisposition: Disposition refers to the arrangement or attitude. For a traffic light, disposition might refer to how the lights are arranged. But that's covered by shape and pattern. Not sure. Maybe not relevant.\n\nFunction: The function is to control traffic flow. This is obviously crucial. So function is a key descriptor.\n\nSize: The size of a traffic light affects visibility. If it's too small, drivers might not see it. So size is relevant for effectiveness.\n\nWeight: Weight is probably not a key factor unless considering installation, but for understanding the concept, weight isn't necessary. So false.\n\nTemperature: Traffic lights don't operate based on temperature. Unless in extreme conditions, but generally not relevant. False.\n\nValue: Value in terms of cost or importance? Not directly relevant to the concept's description. So false.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Colour: true\n- Shape: true\n- Location: true\n- Texture: false\n- Material: false\n- Scenario: false\n- Pattern: true\n- Context: maybe false, but need to check. Since the description mentions controlling traffic at intersections, context (as in where they're used) is part of their function. But context as a property might not add beyond location. So probably false.\n- Disposition: false\n- Function: true\n- Size: true\n- Weight: false\n- Temperature: false\n- Value: false\n\nWait, the example given in the output includes location with a reason that it's always relevant. So maybe location is always true. Similarly, function is crucial. Shape and color are specific to traffic lights. Pattern is about the sequence of lights, which is part of their operation. Size affects visibility. So the final answer would include these properties as true, others as false.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"concept\": \"traffic light\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Traffic lights are defined by their red, yellow, and green colors, which signal stop, caution, and go, respectively.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The vertical or horizontal arrangement of lights and their circular shape are standard for identification and functionality.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is always relevant as it determines where the traffic light operates and how it interacts with traffic.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Texture does not meaningfully describe or distinguish a traffic light's purpose or identification.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Material properties (e.g., plastic, metal) are not critical to understanding or recognizing a traffic light.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario is too vague and overlaps with context, which is not uniquely defining for traffic lights.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The sequence of red, yellow, and green lights (a temporal pattern) is central to their function in controlling traffic.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Context is inherently covered by location and function, which are more specific and universally relevant.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition (e.g., orientation) is not a standard property for characterizing traffic lights.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The function of controlling traffic flow is the defining purpose of a traffic light.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Size affects visibility and compliance, making it a relevant descriptor for effectiveness.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight is not a meaningful property for understanding or identifying traffic lights.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature is irrelevant to the operation or identification of traffic lights.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Monetary or subjective value does not pertain to the conceptual understanding of traffic lights.\"\n  }\n}"

Let's go through each one.\n\nFirst, \"colour\" is definitely important. Traffic lights use red, yellow, and green to signal drivers. So colour is essential. Next, \"shape\"—traffic lights are usually vertical poles with round or rectangular lights. Their shape is standardized, so that's relevant.\n\n\"Location\" is always a key factor. Where a traffic light is placed determines its function in controlling traffic at a specific intersection. \"Texture\" and \"material\" might not be as critical. While materials like metal or plastic are used, the average person doesn't think about the texture or material when understanding a traffic light's function. So maybe false for those.\n\n\"Scenario\" and \"context\" are a bit vague. Scenario might refer to the situation where the traffic light is used, but context could be more about the surrounding environment. However, context is more about how it's applied, so maybe true. But the description says it's a visual signal at intersections, so context might be relevant. Wait, maybe context is part of the function.\n\n\"Pattern\" refers to the sequence of lights. Red, yellow, green in a specific order. So pattern is important. \"Function\" is definitely true because the primary purpose is to control traffic flow. \n\n\"Size\" could vary, but traffic lights have standard sizes. If they were too small, they might not be visible. So size is relevant. \"Weight\" isn't something people consider when they see a traffic light, so probably not relevant. \n\n\"Temperature\" and \"value\" don't make sense here.

So color is definitely relevant. The reason would be that the colors are essential for their function.\n\nShape—traffic lights are typically vertical with three lights. Their shape helps in identification, so shape is relevant. Maybe some places use different shapes, but generally, it's a standard. So yes.\n\nLocation is important because where a traffic light is placed determines its function in controlling traffic flow. So location is relevant. Also, location is universally relevant as per the note.\n\nTexture? Not sure. Traffic lights are usually smooth, but texture doesn't really affect their function. Maybe not relevant. Unless in some contexts, but generally, no.\n\nMaterial—traffic lights are made of materials like plastic, glass, metal. But the material isn't a key descriptor for their function. Unless considering durability, but maybe not essential. Probably not relevant.\n\nScenario—this is a bit vague. Scenario might refer to the situation where the traffic light is used, but that's too broad. Not sure. Maybe not relevant.\n\nPattern—traffic lights have a specific pattern of lights (red on top, green at bottom). So the pattern of the lights' arrangement is part of their design. So pattern is relevant.\n\nContext—context could be the environment where the traffic light is placed, like urban vs rural. But context is a bit abstract here. Maybe not as directly relevant as other properties.\n\nDisposition—this refers to the state or arrangement. If it's working or broken? Not sure. Maybe disposition isn't a standard term here. Probably not relevant.\n\nFunction—obviously, the function is to control traffic. So function is a key descriptor. Definitely true.\n\nSize—traffic lights have standard sizes, so size is relevant for installation and visibility. So yes.\n\nWeight—probably not as important unless considering installation logistics. Not a key descriptor for understanding the concept.\n\nTemperature—unlikely to be relevant. Traffic lights don't operate based on temperature, so no.\n\nValue—value in terms of cost? Not really a descriptor for the concept itself.

The candidate properties are color, shape, location, texture, material, scenario, pattern, context, disposition, function, size, weight, temperature, and value.\n\nFirst, color is definitely relevant. Traffic lights use red, yellow, and green to indicate stop, caution, go. So color is a key descriptor here. Next, shape. Traffic lights are usually vertical with three lights, so the shape helps identify them. Location is important because where a traffic light is placed determines its function in controlling traffic flow. \n\nTexture and material might not be as crucial. While the material (like metal or plastic) could affect durability, most people don't think about the texture when they see a traffic light. They're more focused on the visual signals. \n\nScenario and context are a bit abstract. Maybe scenario refers to the situation where the traffic light is used, like a busy intersection versus a rural road. But I'm not sure if scenario is a standard property. Context could relate to the environment, like urban vs. highway, but again, maybe not as directly relevant.\n\nPattern could refer to the sequence of lights (red, yellow, green), which is part of their function. So pattern might be relevant. Function is definitely key because the primary purpose is to control traffic. \n\nSize and weight might be relevant in terms of installation, but for general understanding, maybe not as much. Temperature and value don't seem relevant here. Temperature of a traffic light? Not really. Value might refer to monetary value, but that's not a common descriptor for traffic lights.\n\nDisposition is tricky. It could mean the attitude or arrangement, but I don't think that's a standard property. So probably not. \n\nSo summarizing: color, shape, location, function, pattern are relevant. Context maybe if it's about where they're placed. Let me check the example given in the instructions. The example says location is always relevant. So for location, the reason is universal. But in this case, location is also specific to traffic lights because their placement affects their role. Hmm, but the example says to put \"Location is always relevant...\" for the apple example. So maybe for location, even if it's specific, the reason is the universal one. \n\nWait, the user says: \"For the always-relevant properties, simply explain that they are universally relevant across all concepts.\" So location is always relevant. So for location, the value is true, and the reason is that location is universally relevant. \n\nSimilarly, function is always relevant? Wait, not sure. Wait, the user says \"relevant descriptors are properties that help meaningfully characterize, distinguish, or understand the concept.\" So function is definitely relevant here because the function of a traffic light is to control traffic. But is function universally relevant? Maybe not. For example, the function of an apple is to be a fruit, but that's not always the primary descriptor. Hmm. Wait, maybe function is not universally relevant. The user says for always-relevant properties, explain that they are universally relevant. So if a property is not always relevant, then the reason is specific to the concept. \n\nSo for function in the case of a traffic light, the function is crucial. But for other concepts, like apple, function might not be as relevant. So function is not universally relevant. Therefore, for the traffic light, function is a relevant descriptor, but the reason is specific to the concept. \n\nSo for each property, I need to decide if it's relevant for this concept and whether it's universally relevant. For example, location is universally relevant because every object has a location. So in the case of traffic light, location is true, reason is \"Location is always relevant as it helps contextualize the presence or use of any object.\" \n\nSo going back to the properties:\n\n- color: true, because traffic light colors are essential.\n- shape: true, as they are typically vertical and have a specific form.\n- location: true, universally relevant.\n- texture: false, not relevant for understanding a traffic light.\n- material: false, unless considering durability, but not a key descriptor.\n- scenario: maybe false, scenario is a bit vague.\n- pattern: true, the sequence of lights (red-yellow-green) is part of their function.\n- context: maybe true, as context (like urban vs. rural) could affect how traffic lights are used.\n- disposition: false, not a common term here.\n- function: true, because the function is central to what a traffic light is.\n- size: maybe false, unless it's about visibility, but not a primary descriptor.\n- weight: false, not relevant.\n- temperature: false.\n- value: false.\n\nWait, pattern: the pattern of lights (the order and sequence) is part of their function, so maybe pattern is relevant. \n\nContext could refer to the environment where the traffic light is placed, like a city intersection versus a highway, which affects its role. So context might be relevant. \n\nSo for each property, I need to make a decision and write the reason. Let me check again.\n\nColor: true, reason is specific to traffic lights (they use colors to signal).\nShape: true, because their shape is standardized.\nLocation: true, universally relevant.\nTexture: false.\nMaterial: false.\nScenario: maybe false. Scenario is not a standard property here. Maybe scenario refers to the situation where the traffic light is used, but that's more about context. So probably false.\nPattern: true, because the sequence of lights is part of their operation.\nContext: true, because the context (urban, rural, etc.) affects their use.\nDisposition: false.\nFunction: true, because it's their main purpose.\nSize: maybe false. While size affects visibility, it's not a primary descriptor.\nWeight: false.\nTemperature: false.\nValue: false.\n\nWait, function is definitely true. The reason would be that the function is essential to understanding what a traffic light does. But is function universally relevant? No, because for some concepts, function is not as important. For example, the function of a rock is not as central as its color or shape. So in this case, function is relevant for the traffic light, but not universally. Therefore, the reason should be specific. \n\nSo for function, the value is true, and the reason is \"Function is a key aspect of a traffic light as it determines its role in controlling traffic.\"\n\nSimilarly, for pattern, the reason would be \"The pattern of lights (sequence) is crucial for the traffic light's operation.\"\n\nFor context, maybe \"The context in which a traffic light is installed affects its usage and effectiveness.\"\n\nSo compiling all this into JSON with the correct reasons.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"concept\": \"traffic light\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Traffic lights are defined by their color-coded signals (red, yellow, green) to indicate stopping, caution, or proceeding.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The shape (e.g., vertical column with three lights) is a standard design that distinguishes traffic lights from other objects.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is always relevant as it helps contextualize the presence or use of any object.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Texture is not a meaningful descriptor for understanding or distinguishing traffic lights.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Material composition (e.g., metal, plastic) is not critical to the function or identification of a traffic light.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario is not a standard property for describing traffic lights.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The sequence of lights (red-yellow-green) and their vertical arrangement is central to the traffic light's functionality.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The installation context (e.g., urban vs. rural) influences how traffic lights operate and are perceived.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition is not a relevant term for describing traffic lights.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The function of controlling traffic flow is the defining purpose of a traffic light.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Size is not a primary descriptor for understanding traffic lights, though visibility is important.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight is irrelevant to the conceptual understanding of traffic lights.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature does not affect the conceptual or functional relevance of traffic lights.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Monetary value is not a meaningful descriptor for traffic lights.\"\n  }\n}"

The concept is a traffic light, and I need to determine which of the listed properties are relevant descriptors.\n\nFirst, \"colour\" is definitely important because traffic lights use specific colors like red, yellow, and green to control traffic. So that's a yes. \n\n\"Shape\" might be relevant too, but wait, traffic lights are generally vertical columns with three lights. However, the shape might not vary much. Maybe it's more about the arrangement than the shape itself. Hmm, maybe not as crucial as color. But some traffic lights have different shapes, like some being rectangular. I'll say it's relevant but maybe not as much. Wait, but the standard shape is a vertical column with three lights. Maybe the shape is more about the overall structure. Hmm, maybe it's still relevant.\n\n\"Location\" is always important because where a traffic light is placed affects its function. So yes.\n\n\"Texture\" probably not. Traffic lights are smooth surfaces; texture doesn't play a role in their function. So no.\n\n\"Material\" – they're usually made of metal or plastic. But does the material affect their function? Maybe not. Unless considering durability, but the material isn't a key descriptor. So maybe not relevant.\n\n\"Scenario\" – not sure. Scenario might refer to situations where they're used, but the scenario itself isn't a property of the traffic light. Probably not relevant.\n\n\"Pattern\" – the sequence of colors changing is a pattern. But the term \"pattern\" here might be confusing. The pattern of lights (red, yellow, green) is part of their function. So maybe yes. But \"pattern\" could refer to visual patterns, which traffic lights don't have except for the color sequence. Hmm, maybe it's relevant.\n\n\"Context\" is always relevant because it's about the environment or situation where the traffic light is used. So yes.\n\n\"Disposition\" – maybe not. Disposition refers to the state or attitude, which doesn't apply here. No.\n\n\"Function\" – definitely yes. The main purpose is to control traffic flow.\n\n\"Size\" – traffic lights have standard sizes, but does the size affect their function? Maybe not critical, but in some contexts, size might matter for visibility. So maybe yes.\n\n\"Weight\" – probably not important. The weight of a traffic light isn't a key factor in its description.\n\n\"Temperature\" – no. Not related to their function.\n\n\"Value\" – doesn't make sense here. Value in terms of cost? Not a relevant descriptor for understanding the traffic light's function.\n\nSo compiling this, the relevant ones are color, location, function, context, pattern, and maybe shape and size. Need to check each again. For example, \"shape\" could be important for distinguishing between different types of signals, like horizontal vs vertical. So yes. \"Pattern\" as in the sequence of lights. \"Size\" might be necessary for visibility.

The task is to determine which of the given properties are relevant descriptors.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each property one by one.\n\nColor: Traffic lights use specific colors—red, yellow, green. These colors are crucial because they indicate stopping, caution, and going. So color is definitely relevant.\n\nShape: Traffic lights are usually vertical columns with three lights. The shape helps in identifying them and distinguishing from other signals. Shape is relevant.\n\nLocation: Where a traffic light is placed (e.g., at an intersection) is important for understanding its function and context. Location is always relevant, so that's a given.\n\nTexture: The texture of a traffic light? Hmm. Unless it's about the surface (like smooth or rough), but that's not something people usually consider when identifying a traffic light. Probably not relevant.\n\nMaterial: What's it made of—metal, plastic? Not really important for understanding its function. Unless in a technical context, but generally not a key descriptor. So maybe false.\n\nScenario: The situation in which it's used. Not sure. Maybe scenario refers to the context of use, but the term is a bit vague. Not sure if it's relevant here.\n\nPattern: Traffic lights have a pattern of lights (red on top, green at bottom). The sequence and order are important. Pattern could be relevant.\n\nContext: Similar to location or scenario. Traffic lights are in specific contexts like intersections. But context is a bit broad. Maybe relevant as part of understanding its use.\n\nDisposition: How it's arranged or positioned. Like facing a certain direction. That's important for traffic control. Disposition could be relevant.\n\nFunction: The primary purpose is to control traffic flow. Function is always relevant for any object, so true.\n\nSize: The size of a traffic light affects visibility and placement. Larger ones might be in busier areas. So size is relevant.\n\nWeight: Not something people typically consider. Unless in engineering, but for general understanding, not necessary. False.\n\nTemperature: No, traffic lights don't have a temperature that affects their function. False.\n\nValue: Monetary value? Not relevant. Unless in terms of importance, but that's not a standard descriptor. False.\n\nSo compiling this:\n\nColor: true, because colors are key for signaling.\n\nShape: true, as it's part of the design.\n\nLocation: true, always relevant.\n\nTexture: false.\n\nMaterial: false.\n\nScenario: not sure.

Traffic lights use red, yellow, and green to signal stop, caution, and go. So color is a key descriptor. \n\nShape might matter too. Traditional traffic lights are vertical with three lights, but some might be horizontal or different shapes. So shape helps in identifying them.\n\nLocation is always relevant, as where a traffic light is placed affects traffic flow. So I'll mark that as true with the note about universal relevance.\n\nTexture and material might not be as important. Unless we're talking about durability or maintenance, but generally, people don't describe traffic lights by their texture or material.

Reason: Shape helps in identifying the structure and distinguishing from other traffic devices.\n\n\"Location\": Where the traffic light is placed is crucial because it's about controlling traffic at intersections. So location is important. Value: true. Reason: Location determines where traffic is controlled and affects traffic flow.\n\n\"Texture\": Traffic lights are smooth surfaces, but texture isn't something people typically note. Not a key descriptor. Value: false. Reason: Not relevant for understanding or identifying the function of a traffic light.\n\n\"Material\": They're usually made of metal or plastic. Material affects durability but not the primary function. Maybe not essential. Value: false. Reason: Material isn't a primary descriptor for understanding the traffic light's purpose.\n\n\"Scenario\": Scenario is vague. It might refer to the situation where the light is used, but that's not a property. Value: false. Reason: Not a standard property used to describe traffic lights.\n\n\"Pattern\": The sequence of lights (red, green, yellow) could be considered a pattern. But the pattern is part of the function. Maybe \"pattern\" here refers to the physical arrangement. If the lights are arranged vertically or horizontally, that's a pattern. Value: true. Reason: The arrangement of lights (vertical/horizontal) is a distinguishing feature.\n\n\"Context\": Similar to location, but context is broader. It's always relevant as it helps understand usage.

The properties to evaluate are color, shape, location, texture, material, scenario, pattern, context, disposition, function, size, weight, temperature, value.\n\nFirst, color. Traffic lights use red, yellow, green to signal. Definitely relevant. Value: true, reason: they use colors to indicate when to stop or go.\n\nLocation. Where the traffic light is placed is important for drivers to know. So location is relevant. Reason: helps drivers know where it is.\n\nShape: Traffic lights are usually circular or maybe rectangular. The shape helps in identifying them. So yes, shape is relevant. Reason: shape distinguishes them from other lights.\n\nTexture? Not sure. Traffic lights are smooth, but do we care about texture? Probably not. Most people don't describe traffic lights by their texture. So value: false. Reason: texture isn't a key descriptor.\n\nMaterial: Made of metal, glass, plastic. But material isn't something people usually note when talking about traffic lights. Unless discussing durability. Maybe not as relevant. So false. Reason: material isn't crucial for their function or identification.\n\nScenario: Not a common property. Maybe context? Let's check context. Context is about the surrounding situation. But scenario isn't a standard descriptor. So scenario is false. Reason: not a standard descriptor for objects.\n\nPattern: Do traffic lights have patterns? Maybe the sequence of lights (red, yellow, green), but that's more about function. Pattern here might refer to visual patterns, which they don't have. So false. Reason: no visual pattern relevant.\n\nContext: The setting where the traffic light is used. Like urban vs rural. But context is more about the environment. Maybe relevant? Hmm. The description says it's for controlling traffic at intersections, so context like the type of intersection might matter. But context as a property is a bit vague. Maybe true. Reason: context helps in understanding usage scenarios.\n\nDisposition: How it's arranged? Maybe, but not a common term. Like orientation? Not sure. Probably not relevant. False. Reason: not a standard descriptor.\n\nFunction: Definitely relevant. Their main purpose is to control traffic. True. Reason: function defines their primary role.\n\nSize: Traffic lights vary in size, but how important is that? Drivers don't usually describe them by size. Unless in installation. Maybe not critical. So false. Reason: size isn't a key descriptor.\n\nWeight: Not relevant. No one talks about how heavy a traffic light is. False. Reason: weight isn't a meaningful descriptor.\n\nTemperature: Traffic lights get warm, but temperature isn't something people consider. False.

The properties to evaluate are color, shape, location, texture, material, scenario, pattern, context, disposition, function, size, weight, temperature, value.\n\nFirst, color is definitely important. Traffic lights use red, yellow, and green to signal stop, caution, go. So color is relevant.\n\nShape: They are usually vertical or horizontal with three lights. The shape helps in identifying them, so shape is relevant.\n\nLocation: Where a traffic light is placed matters because it's about where traffic is controlled. Location is always relevant for objects in general.\n\nTexture and material: Hmm. While the material might affect durability, do people generally distinguish traffic lights by their texture or material? Probably not. They're usually made of similar materials, so maybe not relevant.\n\nScenario: Not sure. Scenario could refer to specific situations, but traffic lights have a standard function regardless of the scenario. Maybe not.\n\nPattern: The sequence of colors (red, yellow, green) is a pattern. That's part of their function. So pattern could be relevant.\n\nContext: The context in which a traffic light operates, like urban vs rural, might influence installation, but is that a key descriptor? Maybe not as much as function.\n\nDisposition: How is a traffic light disposed? Not sure. Maybe not relevant.\n\nFunction: Definitely. Their main purpose is to control traffic flow.\n\nSize: Traffic lights are standard sizes, but maybe they vary. Size could be relevant for installation, but not as a key descriptor for the concept itself.\n\nWeight: Probably not. Weight isn't something people consider when identifying a traffic light.\n\nTemperature: No, that's not a typical property for a traffic light.\n\nValue: Monetary value? Not relevant here.\n\nSo compiling this, the relevant properties would be color, shape, location, pattern, function. Others are either not relevant or not typically considered. Need to check each one again.\n\nColor: True. Shape: True. Location: Always relevant. Pattern: True because the sequence of lights is a pattern. Function: True. The rest are false. Let me make sure about pattern. The pattern here refers to the arrangement of the lights (red on top, green at the bottom, etc.), which is part of their design. Yes, so pattern is relevant. Context might be tricky. If context refers to the environment where the traffic light is placed, like a busy intersection vs a quiet street, maybe not a direct descriptor. So context is false.

Each color has a specific meaning, so color is definitely relevant.\n\nShape: Traffic lights are typically vertical with three lights.

The properties to evaluate are color, shape, location, texture, material, scenario, pattern, context, disposition, function, size, weight, temperature, value.\n\nFirst, color. Traffic lights definitely use colors like red, yellow, green. So color is a key descriptor. Value: true. Reason: Colors indicate when to stop or go.\n\nShape: Traffic lights have distinct shapes, like vertical or horizontal arrangements. Shape helps identify them. So true. Reason: Shape helps distinguish traffic lights from other signs.\n\nLocation: Always relevant for any object. Traffic lights are placed at intersections. True. Universal relevance.\n\nTexture and material: Not as important. You don't identify a traffic light by feeling its texture or knowing the material. Maybe false. Unless the material affects visibility, but generally not a main descriptor.\n\nScenario: Not sure. Scenario refers to the situation in which it's used. Maybe context is better. Scenario might be false.\n\nPattern: Traffic lights have a pattern of lights in order. So pattern (sequence of colors) is important. True. Reason: The sequence (pattern) determines traffic flow.\n\nContext: Traffic lights are used in intersections, so context is relevant. True. But context is a universal descriptor.

The candidate properties are colour, shape, location, texture, material, scenario, pattern, context, disposition, function, size, weight, temperature, value.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which properties are relevant descriptors. A relevant descriptor helps characterize or understand the traffic light.\n\nColour is definitely important. Traffic lights use red, yellow, and green to signal stop, caution, go. So colour is a key part of their function. I'll mark that as true.\n\nShape is also relevant. Traffic lights are typically vertical with three lights, or sometimes horizontal. The shape helps in identification and knowing which direction they control. So shape is true.\n\nLocation is always relevant for any object, as it tells where it's situated. For traffic lights, location is crucial because their placement determines which intersections they control. So location is true.\n\nTexture and material might be less important. While the material (like plastic or metal) could affect durability, it's not a primary characteristic people associate with traffic lights. Similarly, texture isn't something most people notice. So those are probably false.\n\nScenario and context are a bit vague. Scenario might refer to the situation where the traffic light is used, but that's more about the environment than the traffic light itself. Context could be similar. Not sure yet. Maybe false.\n\nPattern could refer to the sequence of lights (red, yellow, green), which is part of their function. So pattern might be true. But wait, the pattern is part of the function. Hmm. Let me check. The pattern of the lights (how they change) is essential to their operation. So maybe pattern is true.\n\nFunction is definitely true. Traffic lights exist to control traffic flow, so their function is a core descriptor.\n\nSize might matter in terms of visibility. A larger traffic light might be more visible. But is size a key descriptor? Maybe not as critical as colour or function. But I'm on the fence. Let's say false unless there's a reason to include it. Wait, the description says \"visual signal,\" so size could affect visibility. Maybe size is relevant. Hmm. But maybe the standard size is part of regulations, so size could be relevant. Let me think. If the size were different, it might not be effective. So maybe size is true. Alternatively, maybe not. I'm not sure. Let me check other properties first.\n\nWeight and temperature are probably not relevant. The weight of a traffic light isn't something people typically consider, and temperature doesn't play a role in their function. Value is subjective and not a descriptor here. Disposition isn't applicable either.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nColour: true, because it's essential for signaling.\nShape: true, for identification.\nLocation: true, always relevant.\nFunction: true, core to their purpose.\nPattern: true, if it refers to the sequence of lights.\nSize: maybe true if it's about visibility.\nTexture and material: false.\nScenario, context, disposition, weight, temperature, value: false.\n\nWait, pattern could also refer to the arrangement of the lights (three vertical), which is part of their shape. But maybe the pattern is more about the sequence. Hmm. Maybe the pattern here is part of the function. So the sequence (red, yellow, green) is part of the function. So maybe pattern is true. Alternatively, if pattern refers to the physical arrangement (three lights), that's part of the shape. So maybe pattern is redundant with shape. But since shape is already included, pattern might not be necessary. Hmm. Need to clarify. The question is whether \"pattern\" is a relevant descriptor. If the pattern refers to the sequence of lights changing, then it's part of the function. If it's the physical layout, maybe shape covers that. So perhaps pattern is not needed. So maybe pattern is false. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is how the lights are arranged (like three vertical), which is part of the shape. So pattern might not be a separate descriptor. So I'll mark pattern as false.\n\nSize: If the traffic light is too small, it might not be visible. But standard sizes are regulated, but for the concept, maybe size isn't a key descriptor. So maybe false.\n\nSo final answer would include colour, shape, location, function as true. Let me check each again.\n\nFunction: yes, their main purpose is to control traffic. So function is true.\n\nLocation: always relevant. True.\n\nShape: yes, helps identify. True.\n\nColour: yes, essential. True.\n\nPattern: if it's the sequence, maybe part of function. If it's the arrangement, part of shape. So false.\n\nTexture: not relevant. False.\n\nMaterial: not a key descriptor. False.\n\nScenario: not applicable. False.\n\nContext: maybe the environment where it's placed, but not a direct descriptor. False.\n\nDisposition: doesn't apply. False.\n\nWeight, temperature, value: false.\n\nSo the JSON will include colour, shape, location, function as true, and others as false.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"concept\": \"traffic light\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Traffic lights use specific colors (red, yellow, green) to signal stop, caution, and go, which are essential to their function.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The vertical or horizontal arrangement of lights is critical for identifying their purpose and directionality.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is always relevant as it determines where the traffic light operates and which traffic it controls.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Texture does not meaningfully characterize or distinguish a traffic light in its function or identification.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Material properties are not central to understanding the purpose or operation of a traffic light.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario is not a direct property of a traffic light but rather a contextual situation in which it operates.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"The sequence of colors (red, yellow, green) is part of the function, not a standalone pattern descriptor.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Context refers to environmental factors, not intrinsic properties of the traffic light itself.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition does not apply to a traffic light, as it is an inanimate object with no inherent state of mind.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The primary purpose of a traffic light is to control traffic flow, making function a defining descriptor.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"While size affects visibility, it is not a core defining characteristic of a traffic light.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight is irrelevant to the conceptual understanding or operational purpose of a traffic light.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature does not influence the function or identification of a traffic light.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Value is subjective and not an intrinsic property of a traffic light.\"\n  }\n}"

The task is to determine which of the given properties are relevant descriptors.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each property one by one.\n\nColor: Traffic lights are defined by their colors—red, yellow, green. These colors are crucial for their function, so color is definitely relevant.\n\nShape: Traffic lights are typically vertical or horizontal with distinct shapes. The shape helps in identifying them, so this is relevant.\n\nLocation: Where a traffic light is placed (at an intersection) is important for its function. Location is always relevant in context, so yes.\n\nTexture: Hmm, texture refers to how it feels. Traffic lights are smooth, but texture isn't something people usually consider when talking about them. Not relevant.\n\nMaterial: They're usually made of metal or plastic. Material might matter for durability, but not as a key descriptor. Not essential, so maybe false.\n\nScenario: Scenario is a bit vague. It might refer to situations where the light is used, but scenario isn't a standard property. Probably not relevant.\n\nPattern: The sequence of lights (red, then yellow, then green) is a pattern. The pattern is part of their function, so yes.\n\nContext: Context is similar to scenario. It's more about the environment where the light is placed. Relevant for understanding usage, so true.\n\nDisposition: Disposition usually refers to a tendency or attitude. Doesn't apply here. False.\n\nFunction: The primary purpose is to control traffic flow. Function is always a key descriptor. True.\n\nSize: Traffic lights come in standard sizes. Size can affect visibility, so relevant.\n\nWeight: Weight might matter for installation, but not a typical descriptor. Not necessary, so false.\n\nTemperature: Traffic lights don't have significant temperature variations. Not relevant.\n\nValue: Value is subjective and not a standard property for traffic lights. Not relevant.\n\nNow, cross-checking with the always-relevant properties. Location is always relevant, so I'll note that. Function is also a key descriptor across many concepts. Others like color, shape, pattern, context, and size are specific to the traffic light's role.\n\nI think that covers all properties. Let me make sure each reason is concise and accurate.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"concept\": \"traffic light\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Traffic lights are defined by their color-coded signals (red, yellow, green) to communicate instructions.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The distinct shape (e.g., vertical or horizontal arrangement of lights) helps identify and differentiate traffic signals.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is always relevant as it determines where the traffic light controls traffic flow.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Texture does not meaningfully describe or distinguish traffic lights in practical terms.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Material is not a standard or critical descriptor for understanding traffic light function or use.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario is not a standard property and does not directly describe traffic lights.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The sequence (pattern) of color changes (red → yellow → green) is central to their function.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Context (e.g., urban vs. rural intersections) helps understand the traffic light's role and design.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition does not apply to inanimate objects like traffic lights.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Function is universally relevant as it defines the purpose (controlling traffic flow).\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Size affects visibility and placement, making it a relevant descriptor.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight is not a meaningful property for characterizing traffic lights.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature does not impact the function or description of traffic lights.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Value is subjective and not a standard descriptor for traffic lights.\"\n  }\n}"
