    "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The concept is a snowboard. I need to determine which of the listed properties are relevant descriptors. \n\nStarting with color: Snowboards definitely come in various colors, and color is often used to identify or choose one. So color is probably relevant.\n\nShape: The description mentions it resembles a broad ski or surfboard. The shape would affect how it's used, so shape is important. True.\n\nLocation: While location can be relevant for objects in general, does it specifically matter for a snowboard? Like where it's used? Maybe, but the question is about properties of the snowboard itself. Location might not be an inherent property. Maybe false unless considering where it's used, but the question is about the board's own characteristics. So maybe false.\n\nTexture: The material's texture could affect grip or feel. If the snowboard has a textured surface, that's relevant. So texture is relevant. True.\n\nMaterial: Definitely important. Snowboards are made of specific materials like plastic, metal, etc., which affect performance. True.\n\nScenario: Not sure. Scenario might refer to the situations it's used in, but that's more about context than the board itself. Maybe false.\n\nContext: Similar to scenario. Context is about the environment or situation, not the object's properties. Probably false.\n\nDisposition: Not sure. Disposition could mean the attitude or maybe the board's tendency. Doesn't seem relevant. False.\n\nFunction: The primary use is to slide down slopes. Function is definitely relevant. True.\n\nSize: Snowboards come in different sizes for different users. Important. True.\n\nWeight: The weight affects handling and performance. Relevant. True.\n\nTemperature: The snowboard's temperature? Probably not, unless it's about usage in cold conditions, but the board itself doesn't have a temperature as a property. False.\n\nValue: Monetary value? It can vary, but is that a characteristic that describes the board itself? Maybe not essential. False.\n\nPattern: Decorative patterns on the board. While they exist, they might not be a key functional descriptor. But some people might choose based on design. Hmm. Maybe true, but less critical than others. Let me think. The question is about meaningfully characterizing. Patterns are more aesthetic, so maybe true but not as essential as others. Still, it's a property. So true?\n\nWait, the candidate properties include pattern. So for a snowboard, having a pattern (like graphics on the base or sides) is a feature. So yes, pattern is relevant. True.\n\nPutting it all together.

The user wants me to determine which properties from the given list are relevant descriptors.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the candidate properties: color, shape, location, texture, material, scenario, pattern, context, disposition, function, size, weight, temperature, value.\n\nStarting with color. Snowboards can come in various colors, and people often choose them based on color. So color is probably relevant. \n\nShape: The description mentions the snowboard resembles a broad ski or small surfboard. Shape is important for identification and function. So shape is definitely relevant. \n\nLocation: Generally, location might be context-dependent. But for a snowboard, maybe not a core property. Unless considering where it's used, but the property here is about the object itself. So maybe false. But location is sometimes considered always relevant. Wait, the example said location is always relevant. Hmm. Wait, the user's instruction says for always-relevant properties, explain that. But the example shows location as true for apple, with reason that location is always relevant. So maybe in this case, location is considered always relevant. So even for a snowboard, location is true. But the reason would be that it's universally relevant. So I need to set location to true with that reason. \n\nTexture: The material of the snowboard might affect its texture, but is texture a key descriptor? Maybe not as much as material. People might care about the surface they ride on, but the texture of the board itself? Not sure. Maybe false. \n\nMaterial: Definitely important. Different materials affect durability, weight, etc. So material is true. \n\nScenario: This is a bit vague. Scenario might refer to the situation in which it's used. But as a property of the snowboard itself, maybe not. So scenario is false. \n\nPattern: Snowboards can have different patterns on them, like graphics. So pattern is relevant. True. \n\nContext: Similar to scenario. Context might refer to usage context, but not a direct descriptor of the object. Maybe false. \n\nDisposition: That's more about the state or attitude, which doesn't apply here. False. \n\nFunction: The function is central. The description mentions it's used to slide down slopes. So function is true. \n\nSize: Snowboards come in different sizes for different users. Important for fit. True. \n\nWeight: Weight affects handling. So important. True. \n\nTemperature: The snowboard's temperature? Not really a property of the board itself, unless considering usage in cold, but the board's temp isn't a descriptor. False. \n\nValue: Monetary value? Not a core property. False. \n\nSo compiling these, the relevant ones are color, shape, location (always), material, pattern, function, size, weight. Let me check again. \n\nWait, texture: maybe the board's texture could affect grip or performance? But maybe not as critical as material. Snowboards have specific materials that determine their performance. Texture might be part of the design but not a primary descriptor. So probably false. \n\nPattern: Yes, as part of design, relevant. \n\nDispostion: Not applicable. \n\nSo the JSON should have each property with true or false and reasons. For always-relevant ones like location, the reason is that it's universally relevant. Others have specific reasons.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"concept\": \"snowboard\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Snowboards are often distinguished by their color for identification and personalization.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The shape of a snowboard is critical to its function and performance on snow.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is always relevant as it helps contextualize the presence or use of any object.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Texture is not typically a primary descriptor for snowboards.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The material of a snowboard affects its durability, weight, and performance.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario is not a direct property of the snowboard itself.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Pattern (e.g., graphics or designs) is often used to distinguish or personalize snowboards.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Context is not a core physical or functional property of the snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition refers to a state or attitude, which is not applicable to a physical object like a snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The function (sliding down snow-covered slopes) is central to defining a snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Size determines suitability for different users and riding styles.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight impacts the handling and maneuverability of the snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature is not a defining property of a snowboard itself.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Monetary value is subjective and not an intrinsic property of the snowboard.\"\n  }\n}"

    "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The concept is a snowboard, and I need to determine which of the given properties are relevant descriptors. The properties to consider are colour, shape, location, texture, material, scenario, pattern, context, disposition, function, size, weight, temperature, and value.\n\nFirst, I'll start by recalling what a snowboard is. From the description, it's a board used for sliding down snow-covered slopes, similar to a ski or surfboard. So, the key here is to think about what aspects of a snowboard would be important in describing or distinguishing it.\n\nStarting with \"colour\": Snowboards can come in various colors, which might help in identifying them, especially in a group. However, color isn't crucial to their function but might be relevant for aesthetics or personal preference. So maybe relevant but not essential.\n\n\"Shape\": The shape of a snowboard is definitely important. Different shapes affect how the board handles, such as whether it's designed for carving or freestyle. So shape is a relevant descriptor.\n\n\"Location\": Location is a universal property because knowing where a snowboard is can be important, but in the context of the snowboard itself, location might not be specific. However, the instruction says to consider if it's universally relevant. Since location is always relevant, I should mark it as true.\n\n\"Texture\": The texture of the snowboard's surface, especially the base (like if it's sintered or extruded), affects performance on snow. So texture is relevant.\n\n\"Material\": The materials used in a snowboard (like the core, base, and edges) determine its durability, weight, and performance. Definitely a key descriptor.\n\n\"Scenario\": Scenario refers to the context in which the snowboard is used, like for racing, freestyle, or all-mountain. Different scenarios might require different types of snowboards, so this is relevant.\n\n\"Pattern\": This could refer to the design on the snowboard's graphics. While it's more about aesthetics, the pattern is a visual descriptor, so maybe relevant.\n\n\"Context\": Similar to scenario, context could involve how the snowboard is used or where it's used. But since \"scenario\" is already considered, maybe context here is similar. However, the instruction says to treat each property individually. Since context is a broad term, maybe it's relevant in terms of usage context.\n\n\"Disposition\": Disposition usually refers to a tendency or mood, which doesn't fit a physical object like a snowboard. So probably not relevant.\n\n\"Function\": The primary function of a snowboard is to allow sliding down snow, which is inherent. But the function is part of its definition, so this is a key descriptor.\n\n\"Size\": The size of the snowboard (length and width) affects the rider's ability and performance. So size is definitely important.\n\n\"Weight\": The weight impacts portability and performance. Lighter boards might be easier to handle, so weight is relevant.\n\n\"Temperature\": Temperature might affect the snowboard's materials, but is the temperature of the board itself a descriptor? Maybe not. Unless it's about operating temperature, but that's more of an environmental factor. So probably not relevant.\n\n\"Value\": The monetary value or cost of the snowboard is a descriptor for purchasing decisions but not essential to understanding what a snowboard is. However, value could be considered in terms of worth, but it's more of a subjective measure. So maybe not a core descriptor.\n\nNow, checking each property against these thoughts. For example, \"location\" is always relevant as per the instructions, so regardless of the concept, location is true. Similarly, function is always relevant because it's what the object does. Wait, but the user said for always-relevant properties, explain that they are universally relevant. So \"location\" would be true with a reason that it's universally relevant. Wait, but the user's example shows that for some properties, like location, they are marked as true with a reason that location is always relevant. So maybe for \"location\", even if it's not specific to the concept, it's still true because it's universally relevant.\n\nSo applying that, for each property, I need to determine if it's relevant to the concept or universally relevant. For example, \"function\" is part of the concept's definition, so it's relevant. \"Material\" is specific to the snowboard's construction. \"Size\" affects performance, so relevant. Let me go through each one again.\n\n- Colour: True, because it's a visual descriptor, though not essential for function.\n- Shape: True, as it affects performance and type.\n- Location: True, universally relevant.\n- Texture: True, affects performance on snow.\n- Material: True, critical for durability and function.\n- Scenario: True, as different scenarios require different boards.\n- Pattern: True, as part of the design, but maybe not essential. But since it's a descriptor, could be included.\n- Context: True, similar to scenario; context of use is important.\n- Disposition: False, doesn't apply to an object.\n- Function: True, universally relevant because it's the purpose of the object.\n- Size: True, impacts handling and rider's ability.\n- Weight: True, affects portability and performance.\n- Temperature: False, not a descriptor of the board itself.\n- Value: False, monetary value is not a core descriptor.\n\nNow, putting this into the JSON structure as specified. Each property should have a value and a reason. For universally relevant ones (location, function), mention that they are always relevant. For others, explain why they are relevant to the concept.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"concept\": \"snowboard\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Snowboards are often identified by their color for personalization or brand distinction.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The shape of a snowboard influences its performance, such as carving or freestyle capabilities.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is always relevant as it helps contextualize the presence or use of any object.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The base texture of a snowboard affects its glide and performance on snow.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Materials like sintered or extruded bases determine durability and snow interaction.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Snowboards are designed for specific scenarios (e.g., racing, powder) that require tailored features.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Design patterns on the board’s surface or graphics contribute to its visual identity.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Context (e.g., recreational vs. competitive use) defines the snowboard’s functional requirements.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition refers to behavioral tendencies, which are not applicable to an inanimate object like a snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Function is always relevant as it defines the purpose of any object.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The length and width of a snowboard impact the rider’s control and performance.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight affects portability and the board’s responsiveness on snow.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature is an external factor affecting use conditions, not an inherent property of the snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Monetary value is subjective and not a core descriptor of the snowboard’s physical or functional attributes.\"\n  }\n}"

Wait, the instructions say if it's always relevant, mention that. But for this concept, location might be more specific. Hmm, maybe not always, but for a snowboard, location where it's used (like a mountain) is relevant. But the example for apple's location is considered always relevant. Wait, the user's example says location is always relevant. So maybe for snowboard, location is always relevant. But I need to check if the property is relevant for the concept. Wait, the user says if the property is always relevant across all concepts, explain that. So location here would be considered always relevant. So the value is true, and the reason is that it's universally relevant. But for some concepts, location might not matter. But according to the user's example, location is considered always relevant. So I'll mark location as true with the same reason.\n\nTexture: The surface of the snowboard affects how it slides. So texture is relevant. Maybe the base material's texture is important. So yes.\n\nMaterial: What the snowboard is made of affects its performance. Definitely relevant.\n\nScenario: Not sure. Scenario might be similar to context. The example for apple didn't include scenario. Maybe scenario is like the situation where it's used. For a snowboard, the scenario could be winter sports. But maybe it's too vague. Not sure. Let's think. The user's candidate list includes scenario. The description says the function is to slide down slopes. Scenario might be part of context. Maybe it's not as relevant as function. Hmm. Maybe scenario is not as directly relevant. Let's mark it as false unless there's a clear reason.\n\nPattern: Visual patterns on the snowboard. While some have designs, is that a key descriptor? Not sure. It's more about aesthetics. Maybe not essential for understanding the concept. So probably false.\n\nContext: Similar to scenario. Context is always relevant?

The example given was for \"apple\" and included location as true with the reason that location is always relevant. So context might not be always relevant. So for snowboard, context might be relevant. Like the context in which it's used (winter sports). But maybe not as universally as location. Hmm. Let's say context is true because the context (winter, snow) is important for understanding its use.\n\nDisposition: Not sure. Disposition could refer to the attitude or maybe the physical arrangement. Doesn't seem relevant here. So false.\n\nFunction: Definitely relevant. The snowboard's function is to slide down slopes. So true.\n\nSize: The size affects how it's used. Larger boards might be for different styles. So size is relevant.\n\nWeight: Heavier boards might be harder to maneuver. So weight is relevant.\n\nTemperature: The snowboard's temperature? Or the environment? Not sure. The board's material might react to temperature, but the temperature itself isn't a property of the board. So probably false.\n\nValue: The monetary value? Not a key descriptor for understanding the concept. So false.\n\nPutting it all together.

But is it essential? Maybe not as much as other properties, but it's a common way people describe items, so I'll say true.\n\n\"Shape\": The description mentions the snowboard resembles a ski or surfboard. Shape is definitely important because it defines the structure and function. True.\n\n\"Location\": The user mentioned that some properties are universally relevant. Location helps in knowing where the snowboard is used, like on a mountain. But wait, the example for apple included location as true because it's always relevant.

Disposition of the snowboard? Like how it's positioned? Probably not. False.\n\n\"Function\": The function is central to the concept. The description says it's used to slide down slopes.

    "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The concept is a \"snowboard,\" and I need to determine which of the listed properties are relevant descriptors. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each property one by one and think about how they apply to a snowboard.\n\nStarting with **colour**. Snowboards can come in various colors, which might help in identifying them, especially in a rental shop or when someone is looking for a specific style. So colour is probably relevant.\n\nNext, **shape**. The description mentions that a snowboard resembles a broad ski or a small surfboard. Shape is crucial because the design of the snowboard affects its performance. Different shapes (like directional, twin tip) are used for different riding styles. So shape is definitely a relevant descriptor.\n\n**Location** is a candidate. While location can be relevant in general, for a snowboard itself, the location isn't an inherent property. However, where it's used (like a ski resort) might be part of its context, but the location of the snowboard as an object isn't something you'd typically describe. So maybe location isn't relevant here. Wait, but the question is about properties of the snowboard, not where it's used. So location might not be relevant unless the snowboard's current location is important, which it's not. So I'll mark location as false, but note that location is sometimes relevant in other contexts.\n\n**Texture** refers to the surface feel. Snowboards have specific textures on their base (like a smooth sintered base) which affect how they glide on snow. So texture is important for function and performance. Therefore, texture is relevant.\n\n**Material** is definitely important. The materials used (like the type of wood core, plastics, metals in the edges) affect the snowboard's durability, weight, and performance. So material is a key descriptor.\n\n**Scenario** might refer to the situations where the snowboard is used. While scenarios can be part of context, the term \"scenario\" isn't a direct property of the snowboard itself. It's more about the usage context, so maybe not a direct descriptor. But the question is about properties of the snowboard, not the situations in which it's used. So scenario might be false here.\n\n**Pattern** relates to design elements on the snowboard. Many snowboards have unique patterns or graphics, which can be part of their brand or style. So pattern is a relevant visual descriptor.\n\n**Context** is a bit broad. If context refers to the environment or usage, it's more about the application rather than the snowboard's inherent properties. Similar to location, context might not be a direct property but part of the usage. So context might not be relevant here.\n\n**Disposition** refers to the state or condition. While a snowboard can be in a certain state (like new, damaged), \"disposition\" is a bit vague. It's not a standard property used to describe snowboards in general. So probably false.\n\n**Function** is crucial. The primary function of a snowboard is to slide down snow-covered slopes. This is a key aspect of what defines it, so function is definitely relevant.\n\n**Size** is important. The length and width of a snowboard affect how it's ridden. Different sizes are suited for different riders based on height, weight, and riding style. So size is a relevant descriptor.\n\n**Weight** matters for handling and portability. A heavier snowboard might be more stable at high speeds, while a lighter one is easier to maneuver. So weight is relevant.\n\n**Temperature** as a property of the snowboard itself isn't typically a descriptor. While snowboards perform differently in varying temperatures, the temperature of the board isn't a property you'd use to describe it. So false.\n\n**Value** refers to monetary worth or importance. While value can be subjective, it's not an inherent property of the snowboard itself. So value might not be relevant unless discussing cost, which is more of a market-related aspect. So false.\n\nNow, considering the always-relevant properties. The user mentioned that some properties are universally relevant. Looking at the list, \"location\" is often relevant, but in this specific case, it's not a property of the snowboard. Wait, the example given includes \"location\" as always relevant, but in the case of the snowboard, the location isn't a property of the object itself. So maybe location is only sometimes relevant. Hmm. The user's example shows \"location\" as true with the reason that it's always relevant. But in this case, for the snowboard concept, location (where the snowboard is located) isn't a property that describes the snowboard itself. So perhaps in this case, \"location\" is not relevant, but the user's example might have a different take. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"For the always-relevant properties, simply explain that they are universally relevant across all concepts.\" So if a property is always relevant, even if it's not specific to the concept, we should mark it as true and note it's universally relevant.\n\nWait, but in the example given, for \"apple\", \"location\" is marked as true with the reason that location is always relevant. So for the snowboard, if \"location\" is considered always relevant, then even if the snowboard's location isn't a property, we should mark it as true. But that seems conflicting. The user's instruction says that a relevant descriptor is a property that helps meaningfully characterize the concept. So if \"location\" is always relevant because it helps contextualize the object's presence or use, then for the snowboard, location would be true. But earlier, I thought that the location of the snowboard as an object isn't a property of the snowboard itself. Wait, maybe the user's example is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the instructions.\n\nThe user says: A relevant descriptor is a property that helps meaningfully characterize, distinguish, or understand the concept in everyday or expert knowledge. So, for example, the location of an apple (like where it's found) might be relevant. But for a snowboard, the location (like where it's used) is part of its context, not the object's properties. However, the user's example includes \"location\" as always relevant. The user's instruction says that for always-relevant properties, we should explain that they are universally relevant. So perhaps \"location\" is considered an always-relevant property. Therefore, even if the snowboard's location isn't a property of the object, the fact that location is always relevant would make it true. But that seems off. Maybe the user is referring to the concept's typical location. For example, a snowboard is typically used in a snowy location. Wait, but that's part of its function or context, not the object's properties. This is confusing. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, \"apple\" has \"location\" as true with the reason that location is always relevant. The user's instruction says that a relevant descriptor is a property that helps meaningfully characterize the concept. So, for a snowboard, the location might refer to where it is used (like on a mountain), but that's part of its function or context. However, the property \"location\" as an inherent attribute of the snowboard isn't applicable. Therefore, in this case, \"location\" might not be a relevant descriptor for the snowboard. But according to the user's example, \"location\" is considered always relevant. This is conflicting. Perhaps the user is using \"location\" in a different way. Maybe the user considers that any object can be described by its location in terms of where it's used or found. So for a snowboard, its typical location (snowy slopes) is part of its description. Therefore, \"location\" is relevant. But the problem is that the candidate properties are attributes of the object itself, not where it's used. The description says \"used in a standing position to slide down snow-covered slopes,\" which is part of the function. So \"location\" as a property of the snowboard might not be directly relevant. Therefore, I need to decide based on the instructions. The user says that for always-relevant properties, we should note they are universally relevant. If \"location\" is considered always relevant, then even if it's not a direct property, we should mark it as true. But in the example, \"apple\" has \"location\" as true. However, for the snowboard, the location (where it's used) is part of its function. So perhaps \"location\" is not an inherent property but part of its context. Therefore, in this case, \"location\" might not be a relevant descriptor. This is tricky. Let me check again the user's instruction: \"A relevant descriptor is a property that helps meaningfully characterize, distinguish, or understand the concept in everyday or expert knowledge.\" So if \"location\" as in where it's used helps understand the concept, then it's relevant. But the question is whether \"location\" is a property of the snowboard or a context in which it's used. I think the candidate properties are attributes of the object itself, not where it's used. Therefore, \"location\" as a property of the snowboard (like where it is physically located) isn't relevant. But the user's example includes \"location\" as true for \"apple\", which might imply that \"location\" is considered always relevant. However, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, or maybe there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the user considers that \"location\" is a property that can be applied to any object, hence always relevant. But in the snowboard case, unless the snowboard is in a specific location as a property (like in a store, at home), it's not a standard descriptor. Therefore, I think \"location\" is not a relevant descriptor for the snowboard concept here. Therefore, I'll mark it as false. But I need to make sure I'm following the user's instructions correctly. The user says that for always-relevant properties, we should explain that they are universally relevant. So if a property is always relevant, regardless of the concept, we should mark it as true. However, in this case, \"location\" might not be always relevant. For example, \"temperature\" of an apple isn't a relevant descriptor. So perhaps the user's example is using \"location\" as a property that is always relevant, but in reality, it's not. This is confusing. Let me proceed carefully.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to evaluate each property based on whether it's a standard attribute of the snowboard. For example, material, size, weight, shape, texture, function, pattern, and color are all standard attributes. Location, scenario, context, disposition, temperature, value are less likely to be standard descriptors. So I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"concept\": \"snowboard\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Snowboards are often distinguished by their color for identification and personalization.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The shape of a snowboard (e.g., directional, twin tip) affects its performance and riding style.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is not a property of the snowboard itself but rather where it is used or stored.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The texture of the snowboard's base (e.g., sintered, extruded) impacts its glide and durability.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Materials like wood, metal, or plastic determine the snowboard's strength, weight, and flexibility.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario refers to usage contexts, not inherent properties of the snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Graphic patterns on snowboards are used for branding and aesthetic differentiation.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Context is situational (e.g., recreational vs. competition) and not a physical property.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition is vague and not a standard descriptor for snowboards.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The primary function of a snowboard is central to its definition and design.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Size (length and width) affects the snowboard's performance and rider compatibility.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight influences the snowboard's maneuverability and rider experience.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature is environmental, not an inherent property of the snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Monetary value is subjective and not a defining characteristic of the snowboard.\"\n  }\n}"

True.\n\nMaterial: The material (like plastic, metal parts) is important for durability and performance. True.\n\nScenario: Scenario might refer to the situations where it's used, like racing or freestyle. So that's relevant. True.\n\nPattern: Decorative patterns on the board are common, so that's a relevant descriptor. True.\n\nContext: Similar to scenario, context could refer to usage environments. True.\n\nDisposition: Not sure. Disposition might refer to the attitude or state of the object, which isn't applicable here.

    "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine which properties from the given list are relevant descriptors for a snowboard based on the provided description. The snowboard is described as a board resembling a broad ski or small surfboard, used in a standing position to slide down snow-covered slopes.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each candidate property and decide if it's a relevant descriptor. Let's start with \"colour\". Snowboards can come in various colors, which might help in identifying them, especially for users or in marketing. However, color might not be essential to the function of a snowboard. So maybe it's not universally necessary, but could be relevant in some contexts. Hmm, but the user's instruction says to consider everyday or expert knowledge. For a snowboarder, the color might not be critical, but for a buyer or in a store, it could be. I'll need to evaluate if it's a meaningful characteristic.\n\nNext, \"shape\". The description mentions that the snowboard resembles a broad ski or surfboard, so shape is definitely important. It helps in distinguishing it from other boards like skis or regular surfboards. So shape is relevant.\n\n\"Location\" is one of the universally relevant properties according to the example. Since the snowboard is used on snow-covered slopes, location is relevant here as well. So I'll mark it as true with the standard reason.\n\n\"Texture\" refers to the surface feel. A snowboard's texture might affect grip or how it interacts with the snow, so it's relevant. For example, a smoother texture might be desired for speed, while a textured base might help with traction. So texture is a relevant property.\n\n\"Material\" is important because the materials used (like the base material, deck, etc.) affect performance, durability, and weight. Different materials can influence how the snowboard handles. So material is definitely a relevant descriptor.\n\n\"Scenario\" and \"context\" are a bit tricky. The example didn't include them as always relevant, but the problem states to consider everyday knowledge. The context in which a snowboard is used (like recreational, competition, terrain type) might be relevant. However, \"scenario\" is similar to context, so maybe both are relevant. Wait, the description says \"used in a standing position to slide down snow-covered slopes\", so context (like the environment where it's used) is important. So context is relevant. But scenario might be more about specific situations, which might be part of the context. Need to check if both are necessary or if one covers the other.\n\n\"Pattern\" refers to designs on the board. Like color, pattern can be aesthetic but not essential to function. However, some people might choose boards based on design patterns. But is it a meaningful descriptor for understanding the concept? Maybe not as much as function or material. So pattern might be less relevant.\n\n\"Disposition\" refers to the attitude or state of being. That doesn't seem relevant here. A snowboard's disposition isn't a property that characterizes it. So probably false.\n\n\"Function\" is directly mentioned in the description—used to slide down slopes. So function is highly relevant. \n\n\"Size\" and \"weight\" are important because they affect how the snowboard is handled. Different sizes and weights can impact performance for different users. So both are relevant.\n\n\"Temperature\" is about the environment or the board itself. The snowboard is used in cold conditions, but the temperature of the board itself might not be a key property. Unless the material reacts to temperature, which could be part of material. But generally, temperature isn't a descriptor of the snowboard itself. So probably not relevant.\n\n\"Value\" refers to cost or worth. While price might be a factor for buyers, it's not a characteristic that defines the snowboard's concept. So value is likely not a relevant descriptor.\n\nNow, compiling all these thoughts into the JSON structure. Let me verify each property again to ensure accuracy. Also, remember to mark the always-relevant properties like location with the standard reason. The example included location as always relevant, so I'll follow that. Other properties like function, material, shape, size, weight, texture are relevant based on the analysis. Color and pattern might be more about aesthetics but still could be considered. However, since the task is to identify meaningful descriptors, maybe color is optional but not essential. Let me check again. The description doesn't mention color, so unless it's part of the design, it's not essential. So color might be false. Similarly, pattern is false. Scenario and context might be overlapping, but context is more about the environment, which is relevant. So context is true, scenario is false. Disposition is definitely false. Temperature is false. Value is false. So the final list would include shape, material, function, size, weight, texture, location (always relevant), context. Color, pattern, scenario, disposition, temperature, value are false.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"concept\": \"snowboard\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"While snowboards may have various colors for aesthetics or identification, color is not essential to understanding or distinguishing the concept.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Shape is critical to characterize a snowboard, as it resembles a broad ski or surfboard and affects its functionality.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is always relevant as it helps contextualize the presence or use of any object.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Texture relates to the surface properties of the snowboard, which influence performance on snow.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Material composition (e.g., wood, metal, plastic) directly impacts the snowboard's durability and performance.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario is not a core descriptor; context or usage environment is more meaningful.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Patterns are aesthetic choices and do not fundamentally define the concept of a snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Context (e.g., recreational use, slope conditions) is relevant to understanding how the snowboard is used.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition (e.g., attitude or state of being) is not applicable to a physical object like a snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Function is central to the concept, as the snowboard is designed to slide down snow-covered slopes.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Size affects the snowboard's performance, compatibility with user height/weight, and maneuverability.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight influences handling, portability, and the user's physical effort when carrying or controlling the board.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature is not an inherent property of the snowboard itself and does not define its characteristics.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Monetary value is not a defining or distinguishing property of the snowboard as a concept.\"\n  }\n}"

    "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The concept is a snowboard, and I need to determine which of the given properties are relevant descriptors. Let me start by recalling the definition of a relevant descriptor. It's a property that helps meaningfully characterize, distinguish, or understand the concept in everyday or expert knowledge.\n\nFirst, the candidate properties are: colour, shape, location, texture, material, scenario, pattern, context, disposition, function, size, weight, temperature, value.\n\nStarting with \"colour\". Snowboards can come in various colors, which might affect their visibility or aesthetic appeal. People often choose colors for style, so this is relevant. So I'll mark it as true.\n\nNext, \"shape\". The shape of a snowboard is crucial because different shapes affect how the board performs. For example, a wider board might be better for powder snow. So shape is definitely a relevant descriptor.\n\n\"Location\". Hmm, location is a bit tricky. The location where a snowboard is found could be relevant in some contexts, like where it's stored or used. But the concept of a snowboard itself isn't inherently tied to a specific location. However, the description mentions it's used on snow-covered slopes, so maybe location is relevant in terms of usage. But as a descriptor of the object itself, location might not be as critical. Wait, the problem says \"always-relevant\" properties. If it's not always relevant, maybe false. But the example shows location as true for apple. Let me check the example again. In the example, location is marked as true because it's always relevant. So maybe location is considered universally relevant here. But the user's instruction says to mark properties as true if they are relevant for the specific concept. Wait, the example says location is always relevant across all concepts. So maybe location is a universal descriptor. But maybe not. The example says for apple, location is true because it's always relevant. But in reality, for a snowboard, location might not be as relevant unless you're talking about where it's stored or used. Hmm. I need to decide if location is relevant for the concept of a snowboard. The description mentions it's used on snow-covered slopes, so location in terms of usage context. But as a property of the snowboard itself, maybe not. Wait, the candidate properties are properties of the object. So location would be where the object is located. But for a snowboard, its location might not be a defining characteristic. So maybe false, but the example shows location as true because it's always relevant. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"For the always-relevant properties, simply explain that they are universally relevant across all concepts.\" So if a property is considered universally relevant (like location), then mark it as true and explain that. So location would be true here. Let me check the example again. The example for apple has location as true with the reason that it's always relevant. So maybe location is considered universally relevant. So I'll mark it as true here.\n\n\"Texture\". The texture of a snowboard could affect grip or aerodynamics. Snowboards have a specific texture on the base, like a sintered or extruded surface. So texture is relevant.\n\n\"Material\". Definitely, the material affects performance. Snowboards are made of different materials like wood cores, metal layers, etc. So material is true.\n\n\"Scenario\". Scenario might refer to the situations in which the snowboard is used. But as a property of the object itself, scenario might not be a standard descriptor. Maybe it's more about context of use. So false.\n\n\"Pattern\". The pattern on a snowboard's graphics can be a design element. People choose boards based on aesthetics. So pattern is a relevant descriptor.\n\n\"Context\". Context is similar to scenario. It's more about the environment or situation in which the snowboard is used. As a property of the object itself, maybe not as relevant. So false.\n\n\"Disposition\". Disposition might refer to the attitude or readiness of the snowboard, which doesn't make sense. So false.\n\n\"Function\". The function of a snowboard is to allow sliding down slopes. This is a key descriptor. So function is true.\n\n\"Size\". The size of a snowboard affects its performance. Different sizes for different users. So size is relevant.\n\n\"Weight\". The weight impacts handling and portability. So weight is true.\n\n\"Temperature\". The temperature might affect the snowboard's material or performance, but as a property of the object itself, it's not a descriptor. Unless it's about the operating temperature range. But as a characteristic of the snowboard, it's not a standard descriptor. So false.\n\n\"Value\". Value is subjective and can vary. While a snowboard has a monetary value, it's not a defining characteristic. So false.\n\nPutting it all together, the relevant properties are colour, shape, texture, material, pattern, function, size, weight, and location. Wait, earlier I thought about location being universally relevant. The example for apple included location as true because it's always relevant. So for the snowboard, location would be true. So let me check each again.\n\nYes, location is marked as true here. So the JSON should include all the true ones with their reasons.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"concept\": \"snowboard\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Snowboards are often chosen for their aesthetic appearance, and color can influence visibility on the slopes.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The shape of a snowboard is critical for determining its performance characteristics, such as turning and stability.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is always relevant as it helps contextualize the presence or use of any object.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Texture affects the snowboard's interaction with snow and contributes to its performance.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Materials determine the durability, weight, and performance of the snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Pattern refers to the design on the snowboard, which is a key aesthetic and branding feature.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Function is always relevant as it defines the purpose and use of the object.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Size impacts the snowboard's suitability for different users and terrains.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight affects portability, handling, and the rider's experience.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature is not an intrinsic property of the snowboard itself.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Monetary value is subjective and context-dependent, not an inherent descriptor of the snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario is not a standard property for characterizing the snowboard itself.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Context is more about usage situations rather than the inherent qualities of the snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition does not apply as a descriptor for a physical object like a snowboard.\"\n  }\n}\n```"

Let me go through each property one by one.\n\nFirst, color. Snowboards definitely come in various colors, and color helps identify them. So color is relevant.\n\nShape is important because the shape of a snowboard affects its performance. Different shapes like narrow or wide can influence how it's used. So shape is a yes.\n\nLocation: Hmm, maybe not as inherent. The location where a snowboard is used (like a ski resort) is more about context than the board itself. But location as a property of the board itself? Not really. So probably false, unless the question considers where it's used. But the question says \"properties that help meaningfully characterize the concept.\" Location might be more about where it's used, not the board's inherent properties. So false.\n\nTexture: The material's texture affects grip and feel. If the snowboard has a certain texture on its base, that's relevant. So texture is important.\n\nMaterial: Definitely. Materials like wood cores, fiberglass, etc., affect the board's performance and durability. So yes.\n\nScenario: Not sure. Scenario might be similar to context. Like, the scenario in which it's used. But that's more about usage context rather than the board's properties. So probably false.\n\nPattern: Some snowboards have patterns for aesthetics. But is pattern a key descriptor? Maybe, but not as essential as other properties. However, patterns can be part of design. But perhaps not as critical as function. Hmm. Maybe false, unless the pattern is part of the design that affects performance. But generally, patterns are for appearance, not function. So maybe false.\n\nContext: Similar to location or scenario. The context of use (like snowboarding vs. freestyle) might matter, but the context itself isn't a property of the board. So false.\n\nDisposition: Not sure. Disposition usually refers to a tendency or attitude, which doesn't apply to an object. So false.\n\nFunction: Yes, the function of a snowboard is to slide down slopes. That's central to its purpose, so function is definitely relevant.\n\nSize: Important. The length and width of the board affect how it's used. So size is yes.\n\nWeight: The weight of the board impacts handling and portability. So yes.\n\nTemperature: The temperature of the board itself? Not really. Unless it's about the operating temperature (like in different snow conditions), but that's more about the environment. So false.\n\nValue: The monetary value? That's more subjective and can vary, but might not be a core descriptor. Not as essential as others. So maybe false.\n\nLet me check again. For each property, ask if it helps characterize the snowboard. Color, shape, texture, material, function, size, weight—all these are properties that define the board's characteristics. Location, scenario, context, disposition, temperature, value are less relevant. Pattern and context are maybe not as critical. \n\nWait, pattern: if a snowboard has a specific pattern design, maybe for aerodynamics or aesthetics, but I think aesthetics are part of appearance, but is pattern a key descriptor? Maybe not as much as color or texture. So probably false. \n\nOkay, compiling the answers now.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"concept\": \"snowboard\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Color is a key visual descriptor for identifying and distinguishing snowboards.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The shape of a snowboard directly impacts its performance and intended use (e.g., carving vs. freestyle).\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is not an inherent property of the snowboard itself but rather its environment.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Texture describes the surface quality of the board, affecting grip and interaction with snow.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The materials (e.g., wood, fiberglass) determine durability, weight, and performance characteristics.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario refers to usage context, not a physical or intrinsic property of the snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"While patterns may exist for aesthetics, they are not essential to defining the function or identity of a snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Context relates to usage situations, not the physical attributes of the snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition describes behavioral tendencies, which are irrelevant to an inanimate object like a snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The primary function (sliding down snow-covered slopes) defines the purpose of a snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Size (length/width) affects performance, rider compatibility, and maneuverability.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight influences portability and handling during use.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature is an environmental factor, not a defining property of the snowboard itself.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Monetary value is subjective and not a core attribute of the snowboard.\"\n  }\n}"

So, true.\n\nTexture: The surface texture might affect grip or performance. However, snowboards typically have a smooth base for sliding, but the rest of the board's texture might not be as critical. Hmm, maybe not as relevant. But maybe the texture of the base? Not sure. I'll say maybe false unless specified.\n\nMaterial: The material is important because it affects durability, weight, and performance. Snowboards are made from specific materials like wood cores with metal or plastic layers. Definitely relevant.\n\nScenario: This is a bit vague.

    "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The concept is a snowboard. The description says it's a board that's like a broad ski or a small surfboard, used in a standing position to slide down snow-covered slopes.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each property and decide if it's a relevant descriptor. \n\nStarting with colour. Snowboards can come in various colors, but is color a key factor in identifying or using a snowboard? Maybe, since people might choose colors for visibility or style, but not sure if it's a core functional property. Hmm, maybe not as relevant as others.\n\nShape: The shape of a snowboard is definitely important. Different shapes affect how it performs, like the width and length. So shape is a key descriptor here. True.\n\nLocation: Where the snowboard is located? Like in a store, on a mountain? Not sure. Location is usually always relevant as it gives context, but for the concept of a snowboard itself, maybe not. Wait, the example says location is always relevant. Wait, the user's instruction says if it's always relevant, explain that. So location would be true with a reason that it's universally relevant. But wait, maybe for the specific concept of a snowboard, location isn't as important as the function. Hmm, conflicting. Let me think again. The example for location in the apple case says location is always relevant. So maybe for any object, location is relevant. But perhaps in this case, the user wants to know if the property is relevant to the concept's description. Wait, the user says \"relevant descriptors that help meaningfully characterize, distinguish, or understand the concept\". So location might not be a core descriptor of a snowboard itself. Like, the concept of a snowboard isn't defined by where it is. So maybe location is not relevant here. But the example given in the user's output shows that location is considered always relevant. Wait, the user's example says location is true because it's always relevant. So maybe in this case, location is true. But maybe the user is expecting that for the concept itself, not the instance. Hmm. Maybe the user is considering that location is always relevant as a universal property. But in the context of a snowboard, maybe it's not. This is confusing. Let me check again. The user's instruction says \"always-relevant properties\" should be marked as such. So if location is always relevant, then even if it's not specific to the concept, it's still considered. But in the example, for apple, location is considered true. So maybe in this case, location is true because it's always relevant. So I'll mark location as true with the universal reason.\n\nTexture: The texture of the snowboard's surface might matter for grip or aesthetics. But not sure if it's a primary descriptor. Maybe not as critical as function.\n\nMaterial: The material affects performance. A snowboard made of different materials (like plastic, metal, etc.) would have different properties. So material is important. True.\n\nScenario: Scenario refers to the situation in which it's used. Maybe not directly a property of the snowboard itself. So false.\n\nPattern: Decorative patterns on the board. Not essential for understanding its function. False.\n\nContext: Similar to scenario. Context might be where or how it's used, but again, not a core descriptor. False.\n\nDisposition: Not sure. Disposition could mean the attitude or the way it's positioned. Doesn't seem relevant. False.\n\nFunction: The primary use is to slide down slopes. Function is definitely a key descriptor. True.\n\nSize and weight: These are practical aspects. A snowboard's size and weight affect its use. So both are relevant. True.\n\nTemperature: The temperature of the snowboard? Not really. Unless it's about the environment, but the board's temperature isn't a key descriptor. False.\n\nValue: The monetary value? Not a core descriptor. False.\n\nSo compiling the results:\n\n- colour: maybe true? People do consider color when choosing, but not sure. But maybe it's not as essential as others. Let me think again. If I'm describing a snowboard, color is a visual aspect, but not critical to its function. So maybe false.\n\nWait, the user's example for apple had color as true. So for apple, color is key. For snowboard, maybe color isn't as essential. So I might mark color as false. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe in some contexts, color is important for visibility on snow. But not sure if it's a relevant descriptor for the concept itself. Hmm.

The concept is a snowboard, and there's a list of candidate properties. I need to go through each one and decide if it's relevant.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the concept: a snowboard is used for sliding down snow-covered slopes. So, I need to think about what properties would help describe or distinguish a snowboard.\n\nColor: Snowboards come in various colors. People often choose or identify them by color, so that's probably relevant. But wait, maybe not always? If the color doesn't affect function, maybe it's subjective. Hmm, but since color is a common way to describe objects, I'll say it's relevant.\n\nShape: The shape of a snowboard affects how it performs. Different shapes are designed for different terrains or styles, like freestyle vs. all-mountain. So shape is definitely relevant.\n\nLocation: Where is the snowboard located? Maybe if we're talking about where it's used, but as a property of the board itself, location isn't inherent. So I think location isn't relevant here. Unless the question is about the board's placement, but generally, location isn't a property of the board itself.\n\nTexture: The texture of the snowboard's base (like smooth or rough) can affect speed and performance. So texture is relevant. But wait, texture might also refer to the surface the board is on, but as a property of the board, maybe the material's texture matters. So yes, texture is relevant.\n\nMaterial: The material (like plastic, metal, wood core) affects durability, weight, and performance. Definitely relevant.\n\nScenario: Scenario usually refers to the context in which it's used. But as a property of the board itself, scenario isn't inherent. So probably not relevant.\n\nPattern: Similar to color, patterns can be used for identification or aesthetics. If the snowboard has a design, pattern is relevant. So yes.\n\nContext: Context is more about the situation where it's used, not the board's inherent properties. Not relevant.\n\nDisposition: Disposition might refer to the board's readiness or condition, but that's not a standard property. Probably not relevant.\n\nFunction: The primary function is to slide down slopes, which defines the concept. So function is definitely relevant.\n\nSize: Length and width of the snowboard affect performance and rider preference. Size is relevant.\n\nWeight: Heavier boards might be harder to handle, so weight is a relevant property.\n\nTemperature: Unless the board is affected by temperature, which might be part of its usage conditions, but as a property of the board itself, no. So probably not relevant.\n\nValue: The monetary value could be relevant if discussing cost, but not necessarily a descriptor of the board's characteristics. So maybe not relevant here.\n\nPutting it all together, the relevant properties are color, shape, texture, material, pattern, function, size, weight. The others like location, scenario, context, disposition, temperature, value are not inherent to the board's description. Location is always relevant in some contexts, but for the concept of the board itself, it's not a property. Wait, the user said if it's always relevant, explain that. But location isn't always relevant. The example for location was that it's always relevant, but maybe that's a mistake. Wait, looking back at the example: the user says for always-relevant properties, explain they are universally relevant. But in this case, location isn't always relevant for the concept of the object itself. So in this case, for the snowboard, location is not a relevant descriptor. So the answer should be as per the analysis.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"concept\": \"snowboard\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Snowboards are often differentiated and chosen based on color for identification and personal preference.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The shape of a snowboard (e.g., twin tip, directional) directly impacts its performance and intended use.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is not an inherent property of the snowboard itself but rather where it is used or stored.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The texture of a snowboard's base (e.g., smooth, rough) affects its glide and durability on snow.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Materials (e.g., fiberglass, plastic) determine the snowboard's strength, weight, and responsiveness.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario refers to the context of use, not an intrinsic property of the snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Patterns on a snowboard's surface are used for aesthetics and rider customization.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Context describes the situation of use, not the snowboard's inherent characteristics.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition is not a standard or meaningful descriptor for a physical object like a snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The primary function of a snowboard is to facilitate sliding down snow-covered slopes.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Size (length and width) affects the snowboard's performance and suitability for different riders.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight influences the snowboard's maneuverability and ease of use.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature is an external condition affecting usage, not a property of the snowboard itself.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Monetary value is subjective and not an inherent descriptor of the snowboard's physical or functional properties.\"\n  }\n}"

The task is to determine which properties from the list are relevant descriptors.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each property one by one.\n\nColour: Snowboards can come in various colors, which help identify them. So colour is relevant. True.\n\nShape: The shape of a snowboard affects how it handles on snow. Different shapes for different styles. Important. True.\n\nLocation: Where the snowboard is being used (like a mountain) might matter, but location itself is a general property. But the question is about the object's properties, not where it's used. So maybe false? Wait, but sometimes location is relevant if it's part of the object's context. Hmm. But the problem says \"properties that help meaningfully characterize the concept.\" Location isn't an inherent property of the snowboard itself. So probably false. Unless the snowboard's location is part of its definition. But the description doesn't mention it. So false.\n\nTexture: The surface texture of the snowboard, like the base material, affects how it glides. So texture is relevant. True.\n\nMaterial: What the snowboard is made of, like the core (wood, metal), affects performance. Definitely relevant. True.\n\nScenario: Scenario might refer to the context in which it's used, like a race or freestyle. Not a property of the snowboard itself. False.\n\nPattern: Design patterns on the snowboard's graphics. People choose boards based on design. So pattern is relevant. True.\n\nContext: Similar to scenario. Context might be where or how it's used, but not an inherent property. False.\n\nDisposition: Not sure. Disposition could mean the attitude or physical state. Not a standard property here. False.\n\nFunction: The function is to slide down slopes. But the description already states that. So function is part of the definition. True.\n\nSize: The length and width affect performance. Size matters for the rider's height and ability. True.\n\nWeight: Affects portability and handling. Important for the user. True.\n\nTemperature: The temperature of the snowboard? Not really a property of the board itself. Unless it's about the snow conditions, but that's external. False.\n\nValue: Monetary value? Not a descriptor of the object itself, but maybe subjective. Not inherent. False.\n\nSo compiling all these into the JSON with reasons. For always-relevant like location, but I think only location is considered as always relevant here. Wait, the user instruction says for always-relevant properties, explain they're universally relevant. But in my analysis, location was false because it's not an inherent property of the snowboard. So maybe none of the properties here are universally relevant except perhaps location? Wait, the example given in the problem includes \"location\" as true because it's always relevant. But in our case, maybe location isn't relevant for the snowboard as a property. Wait, maybe the user is saying that for properties that are always relevant (like location), even if they aren't specific to the concept, they should be marked as true with that reason. But in our case, maybe location isn't always relevant. Hmm. Wait, the example given for apple has location as true because it's always relevant. So maybe the user considers location as universally relevant. But in our case, for the snowboard, location would be true? Or is it? Wait, the problem says \"relevant descriptors for a given concept\". So location is a property that can be relevant in general, but for a snowboard, is its location a relevant descriptor? Like where it's located right now? Probably not. Unless the concept is about the use context. But the problem's list includes \"location\" as a candidate, and the user wants to know if it's a relevant descriptor for the snowboard. So, for example, the location of the snowboard (e.g., in a garage) isn't a property that describes the snowboard itself. So maybe the example is wrong, but according to the problem's instructions, if a property is universally relevant, we should note that. But in this case, maybe location isn't universally relevant. Wait, the example given in the user's output format shows apple's location as true because it's always relevant. So maybe the user is considering that location is always relevant, but in reality, for a snowboard, location isn't a property that describes the snowboard's characteristics. So perhaps in this problem, the user wants us to mark location as true with the reason that it's universally relevant. But that seems conflicting. Let me recheck the instructions. The user says: \"A relevant descriptor is a property that helps meaningfully characterize, distinguish, or understand the concept in everyday or expert knowledge.\" So, for the snowboard, does location help characterize it? Probably not. Unless the location refers to where it's used (e.g., mountain), but that's the context, which is a different property. So I think location as a property (where the snowboard is located now) isn't a relevant descriptor for the snowboard. So in this case, location would be false. But according to the example, the apple's location is considered always relevant. Hmm. Maybe the example is incorrect, or the user is considering that location is always relevant. But in reality, for the concept of a snowboard, location isn't a property that describes it. So I'll proceed based on the properties that are inherent to the snowboard. So location would be false here. Therefore, the only always-relevant properties might be none in this case. Let me proceed with the analysis.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"concept\": \"snowboard\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Snowboards are often distinguished by their color, which can aid in identification and personal preference.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The shape of a snowboard affects its performance and is a key characteristic for different riding styles.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is not an inherent property of the snowboard itself but rather where it is used or stored.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The texture of the snowboard's base influences its glide and durability on snow.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The materials used in construction (e.g., wood, metal, plastic) determine the snowboard's strength, weight, and performance.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario refers to the context of use, not an intrinsic property of the snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Design patterns on the snowboard's graphics are a distinguishing feature for users.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Context describes the environment or situation of use, not the snowboard's inherent attributes.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition is not a standard or meaningful descriptor for a snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The function (sliding down snow-covered slopes) is central to defining the snowboard's purpose.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Size affects the snowboard's performance and suitability for the rider's skill level and body type.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight impacts the snowboard's portability and handling characteristics.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature is not an inherent property of the snowboard but relates to external conditions.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Monetary value is subjective and not an intrinsic descriptor of the snowboard's physical properties.\"\n  }\n}"

The concept is a snowboard, described as a board used for sliding down snow-covered slopes. The candidate properties are color, shape, location, texture, material, scenario, pattern, context, disposition, function, size, weight, temperature, and value.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each property and decide if it's relevant. Let's start with color. Snowboards definitely come in various colors, and people often choose them based on color, so color is relevant. \n\nShape is another one. The shape of a snowboard affects how it performs; different shapes are used for different styles of riding. So shape is definitely a relevant descriptor.\n\nLocation. Hmm, the location where the snowboard is used (like a mountain resort) might be relevant in context, but the property \"location\" as a descriptor of the snowboard itself isn't inherent. Unless the question is about where it's found, but the property \"location\" is more about the object's current place, which might not be a defining feature of the snowboard. However, the prompt says \"relevant descriptor for the concept,\" so maybe location isn't a property of the snowboard itself but where it's used. So probably false.\n\nTexture. The texture of the base affects how it glides on snow. A smooth base is important, so texture is relevant. \n\nMaterial. Definitely, materials like the type of wood or plastic used in construction affect performance. So material is a key descriptor.\n\nScenario. Scenario might refer to the situation in which it's used, like freestyle or downhill. But \"scenario\" is a bit vague. If it's about the intended use, then maybe. But as a property, it's more about the context of use rather than the snowboard's inherent properties. So maybe not a direct descriptor.\n\nPattern. The design patterns on the snowboard (graphics) are important for aesthetics, so pattern is relevant. People choose snowboards based on their graphics.\n\nContext. Similar to location or scenario. The context might be the environment in which it's used, but again, not a property of the snowboard itself. So probably not relevant.\n\nDisposition. That's more about the attitude or state of being. Not sure how that applies to a snowboard. Maybe not relevant.\n\nFunction. The primary function is to slide down slopes, so function is definitely a key descriptor. So true.\n\nSize. The length and width of the snowboard are crucial for fit and performance. So size is relevant.\n\nWeight. The weight affects portability and performance. Heavier boards might be sturdier, lighter better for handling. So weight is relevant.\n\nTemperature. The snowboard's temperature isn't a property of the object itself. Unless referring to the environment it's used in, but that's not a descriptor of the snowboard. So false.\n\nValue. The monetary value is subjective, but people might consider the price or worth.

Snowboards definitely come in various colors. People often choose them based on color, so color is a relevant descriptor. True.\n\nShape is important too. Snowboards have different shapes for different purposes, like carving or freestyle. So shape is true.\n\nLocation might be a tricky one. The location where the snowboard is used (like a mountain resort) is part of its function, but the property itself as a descriptor of the snowboard? Maybe not as inherent. But the problem says to consider if it helps characterize the concept. Hmm. Wait, the candidate properties are general. So location could refer to where the snowboard is located, like in a store or on a slope. But is that a universal descriptor? Not sure. The example says location is always relevant. Wait, the example for apple includes location as true because it's universally relevant. So maybe location is considered always relevant here. Wait, the instructions say for always-relevant properties to explain they are universally relevant. So I should check each property against that.\n\nTexture: Snowboards have a specific texture on their base (like sintered or extruded) which affects performance. So texture is a relevant descriptor. True.\n\nMaterial: Definitely. Snowboards are made of specific materials like wood cores, fiberglass, etc. Material is important. True.\n\nPattern: Maybe. Some snowboards have patterns on the deck, which can be part of their design. But is it a key descriptor? Not as essential as color or material. But still, patterns can distinguish different models. Let's say true.\n\nScenario: Hmm. Scenario might refer to the situations where the snowboard is used, like racing or freestyle. But is scenario a standard property? Not sure. Maybe not as directly relevant as function. Scenario might be more about context, which is next.\n\nContext: Similar to scenario. The context of use (mountain, half-pipe) is important, but is context a standard property? Maybe not as much as function. The function of the snowboard (to slide down snow) is part of the description. So context might not be as directly a descriptor as function.\n\nDisposition: Not sure. Disposition refers to the state or attitude of something. Maybe not applicable here. False.\n\nFunction: Yes, the function is crucial. The description mentions it's used to slide down snow. So function is true.\n\nSize: Snowboards come in different sizes based on rider height and weight. So size is relevant. True.\n\nWeight: The weight of the snowboard affects handling. So weight is true.\n\nTemperature: The temperature might affect the snowboard's performance, but is it a property of the snowboard itself? Not really. The snowboard's material might have temperature resistance, but temperature as a property is more about the environment. So false.\n\nValue: The monetary value? That's subjective and varies, but maybe not a core descriptor. Unless it's about the board's worth in terms of quality, but that's more of an assessment. Not sure. Maybe false unless the value is inherent. Probably not a standard descriptor.\n\nPutting it all together. Now check each property against the list.\n\nColour: True, common to identify.\nShape: True, different shapes for different uses.\nLocation: Always relevant? The example says location is always relevant. So even if the snowboard is in a store or on a mountain, location is a universal descriptor. So true.\nTexture: True.\nMaterial: True.\nPattern: True.\nScenario: Maybe not. Scenario is part of function or context. But the example for apple includes scenario as false. Wait, the example isn't given, but in the example for apple, maybe scenario isn't relevant. So here, scenario is a candidate. But scenario is more about the use case. Maybe not as a property of the object itself. So false.\nContext: Similar to scenario. The context where it's used is important, but is context a property? Like, the snowboard's context is its intended use, which is part of function. So context might not be a direct descriptor.

    "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The concept is a snowboard, described as a board similar to a ski or surfboard used for sliding down snowy slopes. The task is to determine which of the given properties are relevant descriptors.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each property one by one.\n\n- **Colour**: Snowboards can come in various colors, which help in identifying them. So, color is a relevant descriptor. True, because different models or brands might use color for branding or user preference.\n  \n- **Shape**: The shape is crucial here. Since the description mentions it resembles a ski or surfboard, the specific shape differentiates snowboards from other boards. True.\n  \n- **Location**: Location might be relevant in terms of where it's used, like a ski resort, but the object itself isn't defined by its location. However, location is a universally relevant property because it's always good to know where something is. So, True with the universal reason.\n  \n- **Texture**: The texture of the snowboard's surface could affect performance, like how it interacts with snow. But maybe not as critical as other factors. Hmm, maybe not as essential. False? Wait, the base material's texture might be important for gliding. Or maybe the deck's texture for grip. But texture isn't typically a primary descriptor. Maybe False.\n  \n- **Material**: Definitely important. Materials like wood, metal, or plastics affect the snowboard's performance and durability. True.\n  \n- **Scenario**: Scenario might refer to the situation in which it's used, like racing vs. freestyle. That's more of a context. But the property is listed, so maybe it's relevant. True? But not sure if \"scenario\" is a standard descriptor. Could be a bit vague. Maybe False.\n  \n- **Pattern**: Patterns on the snowboard's graphics are part of its design. People often choose boards based on aesthetics. True.\n  \n- **Context**: Context is similar to location or scenario. It's a universal descriptor because context helps understand usage. True with the universal reason.\n  \n- **Disposition**: Disposition might refer to the attitude or condition. Not sure. If it's about the board's condition (e.g., new, worn), that could be relevant. But as a property, disposition is vague. False.\n  \n- **Function**: The function is definitely key. A snowboard's primary function is to slide down slopes. True.\n  \n- **Size**: Size matters for fit and performance. Different sizes for different riders. True.\n  \n- **Weight**: Weight affects handling and is important for riders. True.\n  \n- **Temperature**: The temperature of the snowboard itself isn't a descriptor. However, the environment's temperature affects use, but the board's temperature isn't a property. False.\n  \n- **Value**: Value could refer to cost or sentimental value. While it's a factor for buyers, it's not a physical descriptor. False.\n\nNow, compiling this. Need to check each reasoning again. For example, texture: if the material's texture is part of the design, maybe it's relevant. But I think materials are more important than texture. Also, \"scenario\" and \"context\" might overlap with location. Maybe \"scenario\" is not a standard descriptor. So final decisions:\n\n- Colour: True\n- Shape: True\n- Location: True (universal)\n- Texture: False\n- Material: True\n- Scenario: False\n- Pattern: True\n- Context: True (universal)\n- Disposition: False\n- Function: True\n- Size: True\n- Weight: True\n- Temperature: False\n- Value: False\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"concept\": \"snowboard\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Snowboards are often distinguished by their color for identification, branding, or aesthetic preferences.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The shape of a snowboard is critical for its function, affecting how it interacts with snow and the rider's control.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is always relevant as it helps contextualize the presence or use of any object.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Texture is not typically a primary descriptor for snowboards; material and shape are more relevant.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The material composition (e.g., wood, metal, plastics) directly impacts the snowboard's durability, weight, and performance.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario is too vague and context-dependent to universally describe a snowboard's inherent properties.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Patterns on the surface or graphics are often used for aesthetic differentiation and brand identity.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Context is always relevant as it helps understand the usage, purpose, or interaction of an object.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition is not a standard or meaningful descriptor for characterizing a snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The primary function (sliding down snow-covered slopes) is essential to defining what a snowboard is.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Size affects the snowboard's suitability for different riders and riding styles (e.g., length, width).\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight influences handling, portability, and performance, making it a key descriptor.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature is not an inherent property of a snowboard and is instead an environmental factor.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Value (e.g., monetary or sentimental) is subjective and not a universal descriptor of the object itself.\"\n  }\n}"

    "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine which properties are relevant descriptors for a snowboard based on the given description. The snowboard is a board used for sliding down snow-covered slopes, resembling a ski or surfboard. The candidate properties are color, shape, location, texture, material, scenario, pattern, context, disposition, function, size, weight, temperature, value.\n\nFirst, start with the most obvious ones. The function of a snowboard is definitely relevant because its primary purpose is to be used for sliding on snow. So \"function\" is true. The reason would be that it defines the main use of the object.\n\nNext, material. Snowboards are made of specific materials like plastic, metal, or wood composites. The material affects durability and performance, so that's relevant. So \"material\" is true.\n\nShape is important because the design of the snowboard (like the shape of the edges or the profile) affects how it performs. So \"shape\" is true.\n\nSize and weight are also relevant because the size of the board affects the rider's control, and weight can influence how easy it is to maneuver. Both should be true.\n\nTexture might refer to the surface of the board, which could affect grip or how it slides on snow. So \"texture\" is true.\n\nColor is something people might consider when choosing a snowboard for aesthetics, but is it necessary for describing the function? Maybe not as essential as others, but color is a common way to identify objects, so maybe true. But wait, the problem says relevant descriptors. If someone is describing a snowboard, color could be part of that. So \"color\" is true.\n\nLocation is a universally relevant property. Where the snowboard is located can help in understanding its use or context. So \"location\" is true with the universal reason.\n\nPattern might refer to the design on the board. While it's a visual aspect, it's more about aesthetics rather than function. However, patterns can be part of the description, so maybe true. But some might argue it's not essential. Hmm. The description doesn't mention patterns, but they are part of the board's appearance. Maybe include \"pattern\" as true.\n\nContext and scenario are similar. Context is universally relevant as it helps understand the situation. Scenario might be more specific to certain situations, but since the snowboard's use is tied to scenarios like downhill riding or freestyle, maybe \"scenario\" is true. But the problem says to consider everyday or expert knowledge. Scenario might be a bit vague here. Alternatively, maybe \"context\" is more relevant. The user didn't specify, but the example includes \"location\" as true because it's universally relevant. Similarly, \"context\" might be considered universally relevant. Wait, the example includes \"location\" as true with the universal reason, but others like \"function\" have specific reasons. Let me check the example again. For \"apple\", \"location\" is true because it's universally relevant. So \"context\" and \"scenario\" might not be universally relevant. Hmm. \"Scenario\" might be specific to the snowboard's use cases, so maybe true. But \"context\" could be part of that. Not sure. Maybe \"scenario\" is false here. Let's think: the snowboard's use scenarios (like freestyle, downhill) are important for understanding its design. So \"scenario\" could be true. But the problem says \"relevant descriptors\" that help characterize or distinguish the concept. So if a snowboard is designed for a specific scenario, that's a relevant property. So \"scenario\" is true. However, maybe \"context\" is not as directly relevant. The user didn't specify \"context\" as a candidate, but \"scenario\" is. So \"scenario\" is true. \n\nDisposition might refer to the board's state, like new or used. Not sure. The term \"disposition\" is a bit vague. Maybe not as relevant. So \"disposition\" is false.\n\nTemperature is probably not relevant unless the snowboard's performance is affected by temperature, but that's more about the environment. So \"temperature\" is false.\n\nValue is a bit subjective. The monetary value might be relevant for some, but not a primary descriptor. So \"value\" is false.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- function: true (defines the purpose)\n- material: true (affects construction and performance)\n- shape: true (design affects use)\n- size: true (affects rider's control)\n- weight: true (affects maneuverability)\n- texture: true (surface affects sliding)\n- color: true (common descriptor)\n- pattern: true (aesthetic aspect)\n- scenario: true (use case)\n- location: true (universal)\n- context: maybe not, but the example includes location as universal. Wait, the user says \"location\" is always relevant. So \"location\" is true. \"Context\" is not in the example, but maybe not universally relevant. Let me check the candidate properties again. The candidates are color, shape, location, texture, material, scenario, pattern, context, disposition, function, size, weight, temperature, value. \n\nFor \"context\", is it useful? If the snowboard is used in a specific context like a competition or recreation, that might be relevant. But maybe \"context\" is too broad. The user says \"context\" is a candidate. Since the example includes \"location\" as universally relevant, maybe \"context\" is not. So \"context\" is false. Similarly, \"disposition\" is false.\n\nSo the final JSON should have each property with true or false and reasons.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"concept\": \"snowboard\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Color is a common visual descriptor and may influence user preference or identification.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The shape of a snowboard (e.g., tapered, directional) directly affects its performance and use.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is always relevant as it contextualizes the presence or use of an object.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Surface texture impacts grip, durability, and interaction with snow.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Material composition (e.g., plastic, carbon fiber) determines strength, weight, and performance.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Snowboards are designed for specific scenarios (e.g., freestyle, downhill), which define their functional purpose.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Decorative patterns on the board’s surface are common and may serve as brand identifiers or aesthetic choices.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Context is too broad and not a direct, inherent descriptor of a snowboard’s characteristics.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition does not meaningfully describe or distinguish a snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Function defines the snowboard’s primary purpose: sliding down snow-covered slopes.\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Size (length and width) affects fit, control, and performance for different users.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight impacts portability and maneuverability during use.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature is an environmental factor, not an inherent property of the snowboard itself.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Monetary value is subjective and not a defining characteristic of the snowboard.\"\n  }\n}"

    "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding the task. I need to determine which properties from the given list are relevant descriptors for a snowboard. The concept is a snowboard, described as a board that's like a ski or surfboard, used while standing to slide down snowy slopes.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each property one by one. \n\n**Colour**: Snowboards can come in various colors. Color helps identify and differentiate between different models or brands. So I think this is relevant.\n\n**Shape**: The shape of a snowboard is crucial because it affects how the board performs. Different shapes are designed for different styles of riding. So shape is definitely a relevant descriptor.\n\n**Location**: Location might be relevant in terms of where the snowboard is being used, like a ski resort, but is it a universal descriptor? The user mentioned that some properties are always relevant. Location is often context-dependent, so maybe not universally relevant here. I'll mark this as false unless there's a specific reason.\n\n**Texture**: The texture of the snowboard's surface might affect grip or how it feels when handling. However, most snowboards have a smooth surface, so maybe texture isn't as important. Not sure. Maybe not a key descriptor.\n\n**Material**: The material is important because it affects the durability, weight, and performance. For example, materials like wood, metal, or composite materials are used. Definitely relevant.\n\n**Scenario**: Scenario is a bit vague. It might refer to the context in which it's used, like freestyle vs. downhill. But \"scenario\" isn't a standard property. Maybe not as relevant as others. Probably false.\n\n**Pattern**: Design patterns on the snowboard can be a factor in personal preference, but are they essential for characterization? Not sure. Maybe not as important as others. Could be false.\n\n**Context**: Similar to location, context is about the situation of use. But again, context is a bit broad and not a universal descriptor. Maybe false.\n\n**Disposition**: Disposition usually refers to a person's tendency, but here it's unclear. If it's about the snowboard's attitude, which isn't applicable. Probably false.\n\n**Function**: The function is definitely relevant. A snowboard's primary function is to slide down slopes, and different functions (like carving vs. freestyle) are important. So function is true.\n\n**Size**: Size matters for a snowboard. Length affects performance and control. So size is a relevant descriptor.\n\n**Weight**: The weight of the snowboard impacts its handling and ease of use. Lighter boards are easier to maneuver. So weight is relevant.\n\n**Temperature**: Temperature might affect the performance of the snowboard, but the board's temperature itself isn't a descriptor. Unless it's about the operating temperature range, but that's more technical. Probably not relevant as a standard property.\n\n**Value**: Value could refer to price or worth. While important in purchasing decisions, it's not a characteristic inherent to the snowboard's description. So maybe false.\n\nNow, for always-relevant properties. The user mentioned that some properties are universally relevant. Location and context are sometimes considered universally relevant because they help contextualize. But according to the example, location is marked as always relevant. However, in the example given, \"apple's location\" is considered relevant because location is always relevant. Wait, in the example, they said location is always relevant. So for snowboard, location would be true with that reason. But I thought earlier that location might not be universal. Hmm, maybe I need to check that again.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says that for always-relevant properties, explain that they are universally relevant. So properties like location, context might be considered always relevant. But looking at the example given, the apple's location is marked as true because \"Location is always relevant as it helps contextualize the presence or use of any object.\" So in the example, location is considered always relevant. Therefore, in the snowboard case, location would be true with that same reason. But earlier I thought location might not be as relevant for a snowboard, but according to the example, it's always relevant. So I need to adjust my thinking.\n\nSo for the snowboard, location would be true. But wait, the snowboard itself doesn't have a location as a property; it's more about where it's used. However, as a universally relevant property, location is always considered. So even if the snowboard's location isn't part of its inherent characteristics, the concept's location is always relevant. Therefore, location would be true here.\n\nSimilarly, context might be considered always relevant. But according to the example, maybe not. Let me check the example again. In the example, context is not mentioned as always relevant. The example includes \"location\" as always relevant, but not context. So perhaps only certain properties are considered always relevant. The user says to apply that for \"always-relevant properties\". The example includes \"location\" as always relevant. So for the snowboard, location is true because location is always relevant. So I need to mark location as true with that reason.\n\nSo revisiting the list:\n\n- Colour: true (helps identify)\n- Shape: true (affects performance)\n- Location: true (always relevant)\n- Texture: false (not a key factor)\n- Material: true (affects performance)\n- Scenario: false (vague)\n- Pattern: false (not essential)\n- Context: false (maybe not universally)\n- Disposition: false (not applicable)\n- Function: true (essential for characterization)\n- Size: true (important for performance)\n- Weight: true (handling)\n- Temperature: false\n- Value: false\n\nSo the JSON would include these properties with their reasoning. For location, the reason is that it's always relevant. For function, color, shape, material, size, weight, function are all relevant because they directly impact the snowboard's use and characteristics.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"concept\": \"snowboard\",\n  \"colour\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Snowboards are often identified and chosen based on their color for personal preference or visibility.\"\n  },\n  \"location\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Location is always relevant as it helps contextualize the presence or use of any object.\"\n  },\n  \"texture\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Texture is not a standard or meaningful descriptor for snowboards in most contexts.\"\n  },\n  \"material\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The material of a snowboard affects its durability, weight, and performance.\"\n  },\n  \"pattern\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Patterns on snowboards are primarily aesthetic and not essential to their characterization.\"\n  },\n  \"function\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Function is critical as it defines the purpose of a snowboard (e.g., freestyle, downhill).\"\n  },\n  \"size\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Size directly impacts a snowboard's performance and suitability for the rider.\"\n  },\n  \"weight\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Weight influences a snowboard's handling and maneuverability.\"\n  },\n  \"shape\": {\n    \"value\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"Shape determines a snowboard's performance characteristics and riding style.\"\n  },\n  \"temperature\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Temperature is not a property of the snowboard itself but may relate to environmental conditions.\"\n  },\n  \"value\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Value (e.g., monetary cost) is not intrinsic to the definition or characterization of a snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Context is not universally relevant for defining a snowboard's properties.\"\n  },\n  \"disposition\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Disposition is not a meaningful or standard descriptor for a snowboard.\"\n  },\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Scenario is too vague and not a standard property for characterizing a snowboard.\"\n  }\n}"
